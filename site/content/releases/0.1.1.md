# Bengal 0.1.1 - Template Hotfix
**Released: October 13, 2025**

This is a quick hotfix release that fixes a packaging issue in version 0.1.0.

## What's Fixed

### Missing Template Files

The initial 0.1.0 release was missing the onboarding template files used by `bengal new site`. This meant you couldn't create a new site with example content.

**Fixed:** All template files are now included in the package. You can now:

```bash
bengal new site my-blog
```

And get a fully working site with example content to help you get started.

## Upgrading

```bash
pip install --upgrade bengal
```

## Note

If you installed 0.1.0, you'll want to upgrade to 0.1.1 if you plan to use `bengal new site` to scaffold new projects. If you're working with an existing site, this release doesn't change anything for you.
