# Recipes

Quick solutions you can copy-paste. Each recipe solves one specific problem in 5-15 minutes.

## How Recipes Work

**Recipes are not tutorials.** They assume you already have a working Bengal site and want to add a specific feature fast.

- **Guides** teach you the *why* and *how* through a learning journey
- **Recipes** give you the *what* to copy-paste right now

Need to understand the concepts first? Start with [Guides](/docs/guides/).

2. **Prerequisites** — What you need before starting
3. **Steps** — Numbered, copy-paste instructions
4. **Done** — Verification that it works
5. **See Also** — Related resources
