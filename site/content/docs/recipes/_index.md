# Recipes

Quick solutions you can copy-paste. Each recipe solves one specific problem in 5-15 minutes.

## How Recipes Work

**Recipes are not tutorials.** They assume you already have a working Bengal site and want to add a specific feature fast.

- **Tutorials** teach you through a guided learning journey
- **Recipes** give you the *what* to copy-paste right now

Need to understand the concepts first? Start with [Tutorials](/docs/tutorials/).
