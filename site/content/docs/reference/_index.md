## Reference vs Guides

| Looking for... | Go to... |
|----------------|----------|
| "How do I use tabs?" | [[docs/reference/directives|Directives Reference]] |
| "How do I build a tabbed interface?" | [[docs/theming/templating|Theming → Templating]] |
| "What's the build pipeline?" | [[docs/reference/architecture|Architecture]] |
| "How do I speed up builds?" | [[docs/building/performance|Building → Performance]] |

:::{note}
**Reference** documents *what* is available (exhaustive, lookup-oriented). **Guides** explain *how* to accomplish tasks (goal-oriented). Use reference when you know what you're looking for.
