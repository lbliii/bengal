## Reference vs Guides

| Looking for... | Go to... |
|----------------|----------|
| "How do I use tabs?" | [Directives Reference](/docs/reference/directives/) |
| "How do I build a tabbed interface?" | [Theming → Templating](/docs/theming/templating/) |
| "What's the build pipeline?" | [Architecture](/docs/reference/architecture/) |
| "How do I speed up builds?" | [Building → Performance](/docs/building/performance/) |

:::{note}
**Reference** documents *what* is available (exhaustive, lookup-oriented). **Guides** explain *how* to accomplish tasks (goal-oriented). Use reference when you know what you're looking for.
