# Core Architecture

The core module contains the foundational data models and build coordination logic.

## In This Section

- **[Object Model](object-model/)**: Site, Page, Section, and Asset models.
- **[Orchestration](orchestration/)**: How the build process is coordinated.
- **[Data Flow](data-flow/)**: How data moves through the system.
- **[Cache System](cache/)**: Incremental build infrastructure.
- **[Content Strategies](content-types/)**: Handling different types of content.
- **[Design Principles](../design-principles/)**: Core patterns (No "God Objects", etc.).
