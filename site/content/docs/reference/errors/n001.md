# N001: Frontmatter Invalid

The frontmatter (YAML between `---` delimiters) in a content file contains syntax errors and cannot be parsed.

## Common Causes

- Missing closing `---` delimiter
- Invalid YAML syntax in frontmatter
- Tabs instead of spaces for indentation
- Special characters not properly quoted

## How to Fix

1. Check that frontmatter has both opening and closing `---`
2. Validate YAML syntax in the frontmatter
3. Ensure dates are in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
4. Quote values with special characters

## Example

**❌ Invalid**:
```markdown
---
title: My Post
date: yesterday  # Invalid date
---
```

**✅ Valid**:
```markdown
---
title: My Post
date: 2024-01-15
---
```
