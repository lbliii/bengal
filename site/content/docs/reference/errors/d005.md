# D005: Duplicate Page Path

Two or more pages are configured to output to the same URL. This would cause one to overwrite the other.

## Common Causes

- Duplicate slugs in frontmatter
- Conflicting autodoc output paths
- Multiple index files in same directory

## How to Fix

1. Give each page a unique slug
2. Check autodoc configuration for conflicts
3. Remove duplicate content files
