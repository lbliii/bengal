# T010: Icon Not Found

An icon referenced in frontmatter, a directive, or inline syntax does not exist in Bengal's icon library.

## Common Causes

- Typo in the icon name (e.g., `icon: warnng` instead of `icon: warning`)
- Using an icon that hasn't been added to your theme
- Referencing a Phosphor icon name that differs from Bengal's naming

## How to Fix

1. **Check the icon name** — Run `bengal icons` to list all available icons
2. **Fix typos** — Common mistakes include missing letters or wrong separators
3. **Add missing icons** — Download from [Phosphor Icons](https://phosphoricons.com/) and add to your theme

## Example

**❌ Invalid** (typo):
```yaml
---
title: My Page
icon: warnng
---
```

**✅ Valid**:
```yaml
---
title: My Page
icon: warning
---
```

**❌ Invalid** (icon doesn't exist):
```markdown
{icon}`my-custom-icon`
```

**✅ Valid** (after adding the icon):
```markdown
{icon}`terminal`
```

## Adding Custom Icons

Place SVG files in your theme's icons directory:

```
themes/your-theme/assets/icons/
├── my-custom-icon.svg
└── another-icon.svg
```

Icon requirements:
- `viewBox="0 0 256 256"` (Phosphor's native size)
- `fill="none"` on root `<svg>` element
- `fill="currentColor"` on `<path>` elements
- Include `<title>` for accessibility
