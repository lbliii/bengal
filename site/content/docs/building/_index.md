# Building

Configuration, CLI workflows, performance optimization, and deployment.

## Overview

Bengal's build system provides:

- **Flexible configuration** — `bengal.toml` with environment-specific overrides
- **Powerful CLI** — Commands for building, serving, validating, and more
- **High performance** — Incremental builds, parallel processing, and smart caching
- **Easy deployment** — One-command deployment to popular platforms
