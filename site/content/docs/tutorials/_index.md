# Tutorials

Guided, hands-on learning journeys that take you from beginner to confident Bengal user.

## What Makes a Tutorial?

Tutorials are **learning-oriented** — they help you acquire skills through guided practice. Unlike how-to guides (which solve specific problems), tutorials teach foundational skills you'll use repeatedly.

Each tutorial:
- **Starts from scratch** — No prior Bengal knowledge assumed
- **Builds progressively** — Each step builds on the previous
- **Provides working code** — Copy, run, and see results
- **Explains the "why"** — Understand concepts as you go
