:::{dropdown} What makes a good tutorial?
Tutorials are **learning-oriented** — they teach skills through guided practice.

Each tutorial:
- **Starts from scratch** — No prior Bengal knowledge assumed
- **Builds progressively** — Each step builds on the previous
- **Provides working code** — Copy, run, and see results
- **Explains the "why"** — Understand concepts as you go

This follows the [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) documentation framework.
