# About Bengal

A Python-native static site generator built for simplicity and performance.

## Why Bengal?

- **Python-native** — Use the tools you know (pip, venv, Jinja2)
- **Parallel builds** — Free-threaded Python support for large sites
- **Incremental builds** — Only rebuild what changed
- **Zero JavaScript required** — Unless you want it
