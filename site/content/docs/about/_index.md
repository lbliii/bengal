# About Bengal

**Build static sites in Python, without the compromises.**

Bengal is the static site generator for Python teams who want to ship fast without fighting their tools.

---

## Our Philosophy

### Developer Experience First

We optimize for developer experience over raw build speed. Fast iteration matters more than fast builds. Good defaults matter more than infinite configurability. Helpful errors matter more than silent failures.

### Python Deserves a Modern SSG

Python is the #1 language for many developers. They shouldn't have to learn Go, Ruby, or JavaScript just to build a website. Bengal lets you stay in Python—the language you already know.

### Mixed Content is the Norm

Real sites mix documentation, blogs, landing pages, and portfolios. Tools that force you into one content type create friction. Bengal handles everything in one cohesive tool.

### Honesty Builds Trust

We tell you when to use something else. We acknowledge limitations upfront. We set realistic expectations. We'd rather you use the right tool than struggle with the wrong one.

## Core Beliefs

1. **Developer experience matters more than raw speed** (for most use cases)
2. **Python developers deserve a Python-native SSG**
3. **Mixed content is the norm, not the exception**
4. **Incremental builds are the future**
5. **Honesty builds trust**

## What Makes Bengal Different

| Capability | What It Means |
|------------|---------------|
| **Python-native** | Templates, plugins, config—all Python. No context switching. |
| **Zero dependencies on Node** | Unless you want JavaScript, you don't need it. |
| **Incremental builds** | Only rebuild what changed. Iteration in seconds. |
| **Free-threading** | Leverage Python 3.14+ for parallel performance. |
| **Mixed content** | Docs, blogs, portfolios, landing pages—one tool. |
| **Honest positioning** | We tell you when to use something else. |

## The Problem We Solve

**Hugo** is fast but Go templates are hard to debug. Extensions require Go.

**Jekyll** is Ruby-based and slow. GitHub Pages lock-in.

**MkDocs** is docs-only. Can't build mixed content sites.

**Pelican** is dated. Missing modern features.

**Next.js/Astro** are overkill for static sites. Require JavaScript frameworks.

**Bengal's approach:** Python-native, modern, fast enough, flexible, honest.
