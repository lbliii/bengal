# Features Configuration
# ======================
# Controls what gets GENERATED during postprocessing.
# These are expensive operations that produce output files.

features:
  # Output Formats (files generated during build)
  rss: true        # Generate rss.xml feed
  sitemap: true    # Generate sitemap.xml for SEO
  search: true     # Generate search index (index.json)
  json: true       # Generate per-page JSON files (page.json)
  llm_txt: true    # Generate LLM-friendly text files (index.txt, llm-full.txt)

  # Processing Capabilities (affects rendering)
  # Note: Currently always enabled - wiring to parser is a future enhancement
  syntax_highlighting: true  # Code block highlighting with Pygments

  # Note: Some content properties like reading_time, excerpt, toc are
  # ALWAYS computed by Bengal. They're controlled by:
  #   - content.yaml: HOW to compute (reading_speed, excerpt_length, etc.)
  #   - theme.yaml: WHETHER to display (show_reading_time, etc.)

# Social Cards Configuration
# ==========================
# Auto-generates Open Graph images for social media sharing.
# When links are shared on Twitter, Slack, Discord, etc., users see
# branded preview cards with the page title, description, and site branding.
#
# Generated images are 1200x630px PNGs placed in /social/
# Per-page control: set `social_card: false` in frontmatter to disable
#                   set `image: /path.png` in frontmatter to use custom image

  enabled: false                # Disabled until fonts are properly configured
  template: "default"           # "default" (branded) or "minimal" (centered)
  background_color: "#0f172a"   # Slate-900 - matches dark theme
