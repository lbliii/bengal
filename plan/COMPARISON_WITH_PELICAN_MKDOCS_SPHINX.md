# Bengal SSG vs Pelican, MkDocs, and Sphinx

**Date**: October 3, 2025  
**Status**: Comparative Analysis  

---

## Executive Summary

**Bengal SSG** is a modern, modular static site generator that positions itself between general-purpose blog generators (like Pelican) and documentation-focused tools (like MkDocs/Sphinx). Its key differentiator is a **clean, non-monolithic architecture** with **performance optimization** (incremental builds, parallel processing) while remaining flexible for both blogs and documentation.

### Quick Positioning
- **Pelican Alternative**: More modular, faster incremental builds, cleaner architecture
- **MkDocs Alternative**: More powerful for blogs, better theme system, advanced template functions
- **Sphinx Alternative**: Simpler to use, Markdown-first, better for general content (not just technical docs)

## Detailed Comparison

### 1. Primary Purpose & Use Cases

| Aspect | Bengal | Pelican | MkDocs | Sphinx |
|--------|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| **Primary Purpose** | General SSG (blogs + docs) | Blogs & general sites | Project documentation | Technical documentation |
| **Best For** | Content sites, blogs, portfolios, small-medium docs | Personal blogs, portfolios | Software project docs | API/technical documentation, Python projects |
| **Target Users** | Developers wanting flexibility | Bloggers, Python developers | Developers needing simple docs | Technical writers, library maintainers |
| **Content Types** | Pages, posts, documentation | Articles, pages | Documentation pages | Reference docs, tutorials |

**Bengal's Position**: Hybrid approach - powerful enough for documentation, flexible enough for blogs

### 2. Architecture & Design Philosophy

#### Bengal (Our SSG)
✅ **Strengths**:
- **Modular architecture**: No "God objects" - Site, Page, Section, Asset are cleanly separated
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Objects compose rather than inherit
- **Iterative traversal**: Avoids stack overflow issues with deep hierarchies
- **Incremental builds**: 18-42x faster rebuilds (SHA256 hashing, dependency tracking)
- **Parallel processing**: Pages, assets, post-processing run concurrently
- **55+ template functions** organized in 10 focused modules (not one giant utility class)

⚠️ **Weaknesses**:
- No plugin system yet (architecture ready, implementation pending)
- No reStructuredText support (Markdown only)
- Newer project (less battle-tested than competitors)

#### Pelican
- **Monolithic approach**: Large plugin system but core can be complex
- **Plugin-heavy**: Relies heavily on plugins for features
- **Complex configuration**: More difficult to understand and customize
- **Mature**: 10+ years of development, battle-tested

#### MkDocs
- **Simple, focused**: Does one thing well (documentation)
- **Limited flexibility**: Hard to use for non-documentation sites
- **Easy configuration**: Minimal setup required
- **Theme limitations**: Fewer customization options

#### Sphinx
- **Powerful but complex**: Steep learning curve
- **reStructuredText-first**: Markdown support requires extensions
- **Monolithic**: Large codebase, harder to understand internals
- **Enterprise-grade**: Used by major projects (Python docs, ReadTheDocs)
