## ❌ Critical Blockers (Must Fix)

### 1. **Empty CHANGELOG.md** ⛔ BLOCKER
**Severity:** Critical  
**Impact:** Release communication

**Current State:**
```markdown
# Changelog
```

**Why It Matters:**
- PyPI users expect a changelog for releases
- Shows project maturity and professionalism
- Helps users understand what's in v0.1.0
- Standard practice for open source releases

**Fix Required:**
Create a proper v0.1.0 changelog entry:

```markdown
# Changelog

## [0.1.0] - 2025-10-13

### Initial Release

- Test coverage at 17% (actively improving)

### Requirements
- Python 3.13+ (3.14t recommended for 1.8x speedup)
- See README.md for full dependency list
```

**Effort:** 1 hour  
**Priority:** MUST HAVE before release

---

### 2. **Incremental Build Bug** ⛔ BLOCKER
**Severity:** Critical  
**Impact:** Core feature is broken

**Current State:**
```
Running incremental build (single page change)...
Config file changed - performing full rebuild
```

**The Problem:**
- Incremental builds are advertised as a key feature
- Currently triggers full rebuild incorrectly
- Users get 1.1x speedup instead of promised 15-50x
- Config change detection is triggering when it shouldn't

**Impact on Users:**
- Defeats entire purpose of incremental builds
- Wastes developer time waiting for full rebuilds
- Makes development workflow painful

**From Your Docs (plan/active/CRITICAL_ISSUES.md):**
> Issue #1: Incremental Builds Doing Full Rebuilds ⚠️ CRITICAL
>
> **Severity**: Critical - Core feature is broken  
> **Impact**: Users get 1.1x speedup instead of 15-50x  
> **User Pain**: High - defeats entire purpose of incremental builds

**Fix Required:**
- Debug config change detection in `bengal/orchestration/incremental.py`
- Fix cache invalidation logic
- Verify incremental builds actually work
- Add integration tests for incremental builds

**Effort:** 4-8 hours  
**Priority:** MUST FIX before release

**Why You Can't Ship With This:**
- Feature advertised prominently in README
- Users will immediately notice it's broken
- First GitHub issue will be "incremental builds don't work"
- Damages credibility and trust

---

### 3. **17% Test Coverage** ⚠️ CRITICAL CONCERN
**Severity:** High  
**Impact:** Code quality and reliability

**Current State:**
```
TOTAL: 16336 lines, 13621 untested, 17% coverage
2048 tests collected
```

**What This Means:**
- 83% of code has no tests
- High risk of bugs in production
- Difficult to refactor safely
- 15 major features have zero tests

**Untested Critical Features:**
From `plan/TEST_COVERAGE_AUDIT.md`:
1. Data table directive (390 lines) - **user-facing**
2. CLI scaffolding system (529 lines) - **first user experience**
3. Swizzle manager (289 lines) - **theme customization**
4. DotDict utility (254 lines) - **used everywhere in templates**
5. Jinja2 utilities (153 lines) - **core template functionality**
6. CLI output system (393 lines)
7. Build summary (434 lines)
8. Template tests (149 lines)
9. Paths utility (123 lines)
10. Live progress
11. Performance collector
12. Performance report
13. Rich console
14. URL strategy
15. Theme registry (partially tested)

**Risk Assessment:**
- **High Risk (No Tests):**
  - Data table directive (used in docs)
  - CLI init/new (first user experience)
  - DotDict (core template functionality)

- **Medium Risk:**
  - Swizzle manager (file operations)
  - Jinja2 utilities (undefined handling)

**Why This Matters for Release:**
- 17% coverage is extremely low for any release
- Industry standard for release: 70-80%+
- Alpha status acknowledges this, but still risky
- Will get bug reports immediately

**Options:**

**Option A: Ship As Is (Not Recommended)**
- Acknowledge in README: "Alpha quality, 17% test coverage"
- Add prominent warning in docs
- Mark as `Development Status :: 3 - Alpha`
- Risk: Early adopters hit bugs, bad reputation

**Option B: Raise Coverage to 40-50% (Recommended)**
- Focus on critical path features (2-3 weeks)
- Test the features users touch first:
  - CLI commands (new, build, serve)
  - Data table directive
  - DotDict utility
  - Basic rendering pipeline
- Ship with "Alpha, improving" status
- Better balance of time vs. quality

**Option C: Raise Coverage to 70%+ (Ideal)**
- Comprehensive test suite (4-6 weeks)
- Full feature coverage
- Ship with more confidence
- But delays release significantly

**Recommendation:** Option B - get to 40-50% coverage, clearly document limitations, ship as alpha, improve over time.

**Effort for Option B:** 2-3 weeks  
**Priority:** SHOULD FIX before release (or clearly acknowledge)

---

## ⚠️ Major Concerns (Should Fix)

### 4. **Performance Degradation at Scale**
**Severity:** Medium  
**Impact:** Large site users

**Current State:**
From benchmarks:
- 1K pages: 141 pages/sec (9.4s) ✅
- 5K pages: 71 pages/sec (92s) ⚠️ 50% degradation
- 10K pages: 29 pages/sec (451s) ❌ 79% degradation

**The Problem:**
- Performance collapses at scale
- Likely O(n²) algorithm somewhere
- Memory pressure at 10K+ pages

**Impact:**
- Still faster than Sphinx for most users
- But won't scale to enterprise sites
- Need to document limitations

**Fix Required:**
- Profile and identify O(n²) bottlenecks
- Or clearly document in README:
  ```markdown
  ## Performance Characteristics

  - **Sweet spot:** 100-2,000 pages
  - **Good:** 2,000-5,000 pages
  - **Degraded:** 5,000-10,000 pages
  - **Not recommended:** 10,000+ pages
  ```

**Decision:**
- Option A: Fix the bottleneck (effort: unknown, 1-3 weeks)
- Option B: Document the limitation and move on
- **Recommendation:** Option B for v0.1.0, fix in v0.2.0

---

### 5. **Python 3.13+ Requirement**
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** Limited audience

**Current State:**
```toml
requires-python = ">=3.13"
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Python 3.13 released October 2024 (1 year old)
- Python 3.14 released October 2024 (1 month old)
- Many users still on 3.10-3.12
- Limits initial adoption

**Considerations:**
- Free-threading (3.14t) gives 1.8x speedup
- Modern syntax features (PEP 695 generics)
- You've committed to this choice

**Decision:**
- Keep the requirement
- Clearly state in README (you do)
- Accept smaller initial audience
- Position as "next-gen Python SSG"

**No action required** - just be aware of trade-off.

---

### 6. **Some Features May Be Incomplete**
**Severity:** Low  
**Impact:** User confusion

From your planning docs, I see:
- Incremental builds being debugged
- Performance being actively optimized
- Scale issues being investigated

**Recommendation:**
- Be transparent in README about what's stable vs. experimental
- Add "Status" badges or section:
  ```markdown
  ## Feature Status

  | Feature | Status | Notes |
  |---------|--------|-------|
  | Core builds | ✅ Stable | |
  | Parallel processing | ✅ Stable | |
  | Templates | ✅ Stable | |
  | Incremental builds | ⚠️ Beta | Under active development |
  | Large sites (10K+ pages) | ⚠️ Beta | Performance degrades |
  | API autodoc | ✅ Stable | |
  ```

## 🤔 What You Need to Decide

### Decision 1: Fix Incremental Builds First?
**Options:**
- A) Fix the bug, verify it works, then release (4-8 hours + testing)
- B) Disable incremental builds for v0.1.0, fix in v0.2.0
- C) Ship with known bug, mark as "experimental"

**Recommendation:** Option A - fix it first, it's a core feature.

### Decision 2: Test Coverage Threshold?
**Options:**
- A) Ship at 17%, mark as "Alpha quality"
- B) Get to 40-50%, test critical path (2-3 weeks)
- C) Get to 70%+, delay release (4-6 weeks)

**Recommendation:** Option B if you have time, Option A if you need to ship now.

### Decision 3: Performance Issues?
**Options:**
- A) Fix scale issues before release (unknown effort)
- B) Document limitations, fix in v0.2.0

**Recommendation:** Option B - document and move on.

## 💡 My Honest Recommendation

### Ship in 1-2 Weeks with These Changes:

1. **Fix the incremental build bug** (non-negotiable)
2. **Write a proper CHANGELOG** (non-negotiable)
3. **Document limitations clearly** (important)
4. **Add basic tests for CLI** (important)
5. **Test fresh install thoroughly** (important)

### Be Transparent:

Add to README:
```markdown
## Project Status: Alpha Release

Bengal v0.1.0 is an **alpha release** suitable for:
- ✅ Early adopters and experimenters
- ✅ Sites with 100-2,000 pages
- ✅ Developers wanting AST-based API docs
- ✅ Python 3.13+ projects

Not yet recommended for:
- ❌ Mission-critical production sites
- ❌ Sites with 10,000+ pages
- ❌ Teams requiring extensive test coverage

We're actively improving test coverage and performance. Contributions welcome!
```

### Version Strategy:
- v0.1.0 - Alpha: Core features work, known limitations
- v0.2.0 - Beta: 50%+ test coverage, incremental builds solid
- v0.3.0 - Beta: 70%+ coverage, scale issues resolved
- v1.0.0 - Stable: Production-ready, comprehensive tests

## 🎯 Bottom Line

**Can you publish to PyPI right now?** Technically yes, but **you shouldn't**.

**Why not?**
1. Empty CHANGELOG looks unprofessional
2. Incremental builds are broken (core feature)
3. 17% test coverage is risky even for alpha

**Minimum to fix:** 10-15 hours focused work
**Recommended to fix:** 2-3 weeks part-time

**Your project is 85% ready.** Don't rush the last 15% and damage your reputation. Take 1-2 weeks to fix critical issues, then launch with confidence.
