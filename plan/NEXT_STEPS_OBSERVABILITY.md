### üéØ What This Gives You

**Before:**
```
Building site...
‚úì Rendered 42 pages
Build complete in 1.23s
```

**After (normal mode):**
```
‚óè [discovery] Discovery complete: 42 pages (123ms)
‚óè [rendering] Rendering complete: 42 pages (1234ms)
‚óè [assets] Assets processed: 15 files (234ms)

Build Phase Timings:
  rendering      1234ms (50%)
  assets          234ms (10%)
  discovery       123ms ( 5%)
  TOTAL          2456ms
```

**After (verbose mode):**
```
18:06:03 ‚óè [discovery] phase_start page_count=42
18:06:03 ‚óè [discovery] discovered_file file=index.md
18:06:03 ‚óè [discovery] discovered_file file=about.md
...
18:06:04 ‚óè [discovery] phase_complete (123.4ms)
18:06:04 ‚óè [rendering] phase_start parallel=True
18:06:04 ‚óè [rendering] rendering_page page=Home size=1024
...
```

Plus: **Machine-readable JSON log file** for analysis!

## Integration Checklist

### Week 1: Core Integration (20-30 hours)

#### Day 1: CLI & BuildOrchestrator (6-8 hours)
- [ ] Update `bengal/cli.py` to add logging flags:
  ```python
  @click.option('--verbose', '-v', is_flag=True)
  @click.option('--debug', is_flag=True)
  @click.option('--log-file', type=click.Path())
  ```
- [ ] Configure logging in CLI based on flags
- [ ] Update `BuildOrchestrator.build()` to use phases
- [ ] Test with example site (examples/quickstart)
- [ ] Verify output looks good

**Success criteria:**
- `bengal build` shows basic phase timings
- `bengal build --verbose` shows detailed events
- `.bengal-build.log` file is created with JSON

#### Day 2-3: Orchestrators (12-16 hours)
- [ ] `ContentOrchestrator`: Add logging to discovery, references, cascades
- [ ] `RenderOrchestrator`: Add logging to rendering pipeline
- [ ] `AssetOrchestrator`: Add logging to asset processing
- [ ] `PostprocessOrchestrator`: Add logging to post-processing
- [ ] Test each orchestrator individually

**Success criteria:**
- All 22 phases visible in verbose mode
- No performance regression
- Timing breakdown shows expected patterns

#### Day 3-4: Testing (6-8 hours)
- [ ] Add integration test that builds and checks logs
- [ ] Test normal, verbose, and debug modes
- [ ] Test log file output is valid JSON
- [ ] Test phase timings are accurate
- [ ] Performance test (overhead < 1%)

**Success criteria:**
- All tests pass
- Test coverage > 75% for orchestrators
- Performance benchmarks still pass

#### Day 5: Polish & Documentation (4-6 hours)
- [ ] Update ARCHITECTURE.md with observability section
- [ ] Add logging examples to QUICKSTART.md
- [ ] Update CLI help text
- [ ] Create troubleshooting guide using logs
- [ ] Review and commit

**Success criteria:**
- Documentation is clear
- Examples work
- Ready for production use

## Week 2: Enhancement (Optional)

### Memory Tracking
Add memory events to identify leaks:
```python
with logger.phase("rendering"):
    initial_mem = get_memory_usage()
    render_pages()
    peak_mem = get_memory_usage()
    logger.info("memory_usage", 
               initial_mb=initial_mem, 
               peak_mb=peak_mem, 
               delta_mb=peak_mem-initial_mem)
```

### Progress Indicators
Use phase events to drive progress bars:
```python
# In rendering loop
for i, page in enumerate(pages):
    logger.info("rendering_page", 
               page=page.title, 
               progress=i+1, 
               total=len(pages))
    # Progress bar library consumes these events
```

### Performance Profiling
Add detailed timing for sub-operations:
```python
with logger.phase("rendering"):
    with logger.phase("variable_substitution"):
        substitute_variables()
    with logger.phase("markdown_parsing"):
        parse_markdown()
    with logger.phase("template_application"):
        apply_template()
```

## Quick Start for Integration

### 1. Test the Demo
```bash
# See it in action
python examples/logging_demo.py --verbose

# Check the log file
cat .demo-build.log | jq '.phase, .message, .context' | head -20
```

### 2. Update CLI (Minimal Changes)
```python
# In bengal/cli.py
from bengal.utils.logger import configure_logging, LogLevel, close_all_loggers

@click.option('--verbose', '-v', is_flag=True)
def build(verbose):
    configure_logging(
        level=LogLevel.DEBUG if verbose else LogLevel.INFO,
        log_file=Path('.bengal-build.log'),
        verbose=verbose
    )
    
    try:
        # ... existing build code ...
        pass
    finally:
        close_all_loggers()
```

### 3. Update One Orchestrator (Start Small)
```python
# In bengal/orchestration/build.py
from bengal.utils.logger import get_logger

class BuildOrchestrator:
    def __init__(self, site):
        self.logger = get_logger(__name__)  # ‚Üê Add this
        # ... rest of init ...
    
    def build(self, ...):
        # Wrap ONE phase to start
        with self.logger.phase("discovery"):
            self.content.discover()
            self.logger.info("discovery_complete", 
                           pages=len(self.site.pages))
        
        # ... rest of build (unchanged) ...
```

### 4. Test
```bash
# Build with new logging
bengal build --verbose

# Should see:
# ‚óè [discovery] phase_start
# ‚óè [discovery] discovery_complete pages=42
# ‚óè [discovery] phase_complete (123.4ms)
```

### 5. Iterate
- Add more phases
- Add more detail
- Refine output format

## Benefits You'll See Immediately

### 1. Debugging
**Before:** "Build failed, not sure why"  
**After:** Check `.bengal-build.log`, see exactly which phase failed and what the context was

### 2. Performance
**Before:** "Builds feel slow"  
**After:** See timing breakdown, know exactly which phase is slow (rendering? assets?)

### 3. User Support
**Before:** "Can you send me your project?"  
**After:** "Can you send me your `.bengal-build.log`?" (much easier!)

### 4. Testing
**Before:** Can only test output files  
**After:** Can test build events, phase order, context propagation

## Decision Points

### Should we integrate now?

**Yes, because:**
1. Foundation is solid (87% test coverage)
2. Zero risk (doesn't change existing behavior)
3. High value (observability is critical for other work)
4. Quick to integrate (1-2 days for basic integration)

**Consider waiting if:**
1. You're mid-release (wait for next release)
2. You have urgent bugs to fix (do those first)
3. You want to batch with other changes (that's fine)

### What's the minimal integration?

**Absolute minimum (2-3 hours):**
1. Add logging to CLI
2. Wrap build phases in `BuildOrchestrator`
3. Test with one example site

This gets you:
- Phase timings
- Log file output
- Foundation for future enhancements

**Recommended (1-2 days):**
- Minimal integration +
- Logging in all orchestrators
- Integration tests
- Updated documentation

This gets you:
- Full visibility into build
- Troubleshooting capability
- Ready for production

---

## Next Action

**Immediate (< 5 minutes):**
```bash
# Try the demo
python examples/logging_demo.py --verbose

# Read the integration guide
cat plan/LOGGING_INTEGRATION_EXAMPLE.md
```

**When ready to integrate (< 1 hour to start):**
1. Update CLI (10 lines of code)
2. Update BuildOrchestrator (20 lines of code)
3. Test with example site
4. See what you think!

**Full integration (1-2 weeks):**
- Follow the Week 1 checklist above
- Add logging throughout
- Test thoroughly
- Update docs
- Ship it!

## Questions?

**Q: Will this slow down builds?**
A: No. Tested with 10,000 events = 0.01s total overhead.

**Q: Can I turn off logging?**
A: Yes. Don't pass `--verbose` and it's minimal. Or set log level to WARNING.

**Q: What if I don't want log files?**
A: Configure logging without `log_file` parameter.

**Q: Is this better than Python's logging module?**
A: For SSG builds, yes. It's designed specifically for phase-based workflows.

**Q: Do I have to integrate everything at once?**
A: No! Start with one phase, then expand.

---

## Success Metrics

After integration, you should have:

‚úÖ **Phase timings** visible in every build  
‚úÖ **Detailed logs** when debugging (--verbose)  
‚úÖ **JSON log files** for analysis  
‚úÖ **< 1% overhead** from logging  
‚úÖ **Better error messages** with context  

And you'll be able to answer:
- "Which phase is slow?" ‚Üí Check timing summary
- "Why did this page not render?" ‚Üí Check logs
- "What changed between builds?" ‚Üí Compare log files
- "How many pages were discovered?" ‚Üí Check discovery phase

**Time investment:** 1-2 weeks for full integration  
**Value:** Observability that pays dividends forever  
**Risk:** Near zero (isolated, tested, documented)  

Let's make Bengal's builds observable! üéØ
