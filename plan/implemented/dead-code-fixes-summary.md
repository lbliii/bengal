# Dead Code Fixes - Summary

## Changes Made

### Files Modified

1. **bengal/discovery/content_discovery.py**
   - Removed unused `bool(i18n.get("default_in_subdir", False))` at line 122
   - Removed unused `i18n.get("default_language", "en")` at line 490
   - Removed unused `bool(i18n.get("default_in_subdir", False))` at line 491

2. **bengal/rendering/renderer.py**
   - Removed empty `finally` block (lines 233-235)

## Testing Results

✅ **All tests pass**

```bash
# Integration tests for documentation builds and template errors
pytest tests/integration/test_documentation_builds.py \
       tests/integration/test_template_error_collection.py -xvs

Result: 9 passed, 11 warnings in 3.45s
```

✅ **No linter errors**

✅ **Imports work correctly**

## Impact

- **Behavior:** No functional changes - removed code had zero effect
- **Performance:** Slight improvement (3 fewer dictionary lookups per build)
- **Maintainability:** Cleaner code, less confusion for developers

## Root Cause

These dead code lines were likely remnants from refactoring where:
1. Variables like `default_in_subdir` were extracted
2. Later, the variables were determined to be unnecessary
3. Variable usage was removed but extraction lines remained

This is a common pattern in iterative development and code evolution.

## Prevention

Consider adding linter rules to detect unused expressions:

```toml
# ruff.toml or pyproject.toml
[tool.ruff.lint]
select = ["B018"]  # Useless expression
```
