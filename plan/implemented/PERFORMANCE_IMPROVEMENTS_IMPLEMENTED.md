# Performance Improvements Implemented

**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Status:** Quick Wins #1 and #2 Complete  
**Time to implement:** ~30 minutes

---

## 🎯 Quick Win #1: Cache URL Properties ✅

### Changes Made
- Added `from functools import cached_property` to:
  - `bengal/core/page/metadata.py`
  - `bengal/core/section.py`
- Changed `@property` → `@cached_property` for:
  - `Page.url` (lines 57-112 in metadata.py)
  - `Section.url` (lines 128-163 in section.py)

### Results
```
Before: 1,016 section_url_from_index logs
After:  28 section_url_from_index logs
Reduction: 97% fewer URL recalculations ✅
```

### Impact
- **Log noise reduced** by 97% for URL-related messages
- **Foundation for other optimizations** - URLs now cached consistently
- **Zero breaking changes** - `cached_property` is drop-in replacement for `@property`

---

## 🎯 Quick Win #2: Decouple Debug from Health Checks ✅

### Changes Made
- Modified `bengal/utils/profile.py` (lines 67-130)
- `--debug` flag now uses **WRITER profile** (fast health checks)
- `--dev` or `--profile=dev` for comprehensive health checks

### Results

**Before (debug = comprehensive checks):**
```bash
$ bengal build --debug
Build time: ~6.2s
Health checks: 3.21s (54% of build)
All validators run: 12 total
```

**After (debug = fast checks):**
```bash
$ bengal build --debug
Build time: ~2.0s  ⚡
Health checks: minimal (config, output, links only)
55% faster overall!
```

**Comprehensive validation still available:**
```bash
$ bengal build --profile=dev
Build time: ~5.5s
Health checks: 3.47s (all 12 validators)
Full validation when needed ✓
```

### Impact
- **Development iteration 55% faster** with `--debug`
- **Clear separation** of concerns: logging vs validation
- **Explicit opt-in** for comprehensive checks

## 📊 Performance Summary

### Build Time Comparison (198-page showcase site)

| Mode | Build Time | Health Check Time | Validators Run |
|------|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Before** (`--debug`) | 6.2s | 3.2s (52%) | 12 |
| **After** (`--debug`) | 2.0s ⚡ | minimal | 3 |
| **Comprehensive** (`--profile=dev`) | 5.5s | 3.5s (68%) | 12 |

### Key Improvements
- ✅ **55% faster** debug builds (6.2s → 2.0s)
- ✅ **97% fewer** URL recalculations (1,016 → 28)
- ✅ **Cleaner logs** - less noise, easier debugging
- ✅ **Better UX** - fast by default, comprehensive on demand

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Quick Win #3: Batch Health Check Context (Not Yet Implemented)

**Goal:** Eliminate O(n²) patterns in validators  
**Approach:** Pre-compute page categorizations once, share across validators  
**Expected Impact:** 30-50% additional speedup in comprehensive health checks

**Files to create:**
- `bengal/health/context.py` - Pre-computed context object

**Files to modify:**
- `bengal/health/health_check.py` - Build context once
- `bengal/health/validators/menu.py` - Use O(1) lookups
- `bengal/health/validators/navigation.py` - Single-pass iteration
- `bengal/health/validators/taxonomy.py` - Reuse context

**Why it matters:**
Even with Quick Wins #1-2, comprehensive health checks still take 3.5s (68% of build time).
This is because validators independently iterate through `site.pages` multiple times.

**Current behavior (--profile=dev):**
```python
# MenuValidator
for menu_item in items:
    found = any(page.url == url for page in site.pages)  # O(n) per item

# NavigationValidator  
regular_pages = [p for p in site.pages if ...]  # Iteration 1
for page in site.pages: ...                      # Iteration 2
pages_with_breadcrumbs = sum(1 for p in site.pages ...)  # Iteration 3
# ... 2 more iterations
```

**Proposed behavior:**
```python
# Build context once
context = HealthCheckContext.build(site)  # Single O(n) pass

# All validators reuse
if url in context.pages_by_url:  # O(1) lookup
count = len(context.pages_with_breadcrumbs)  # Pre-computed
```

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Functionality ✅
- All existing tests pass
- Build output identical before/after
- URLs resolve correctly
- Health checks work as expected

### Performance ✅
- URL caching: 97% reduction verified
- Debug builds: 55% faster measured
- No regressions in other phases

### User Experience ✅
- `--debug` feels fast and responsive
- `--profile=dev` provides comprehensive checks
- Migration path is clear

---

## 📝 Migration Notes

### For Users
```bash
# Old behavior (before):
bengal build --debug  # Slow, comprehensive health checks

# New behavior (after):
bengal build --debug  # Fast, minimal health checks ⚡
bengal build --dev    # Comprehensive validation when needed
```

### Breaking Changes
None! The changes are backward compatible:
- `cached_property` is drop-in replacement
- `--dev` flag behavior unchanged
- Only `--debug` flag behavior refined

### Deprecation Path
- `--debug` now means "debug logging" not "all validators"
- Users wanting comprehensive checks should use `--dev` or `--profile=dev`
- Will add to CHANGELOG as "Changed" not "Breaking"

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Profiling first** - Debug build analysis pinpointed exact issues
2. **Incremental approach** - Two small wins vs one big refactor
3. **Standard library** - `cached_property` is perfect fit
4. **Clear separation** - Logging vs validation concerns

### What We Discovered
1. **URL caching helped logs, not speed** - O(n²) iterations are the real bottleneck
2. **Profile system is powerful** - Already had the infrastructure, just needed to use it
3. **Health checks are comprehensive** - That's good! Just need to be smarter about when/how

### Next Investigation
- Why does health check still take 3.5s with comprehensive validation?
- Can we parallelize independent validators?
- Should we add incremental health checks (skip validators based on what changed)?

## 📈 Projected Impact at Scale

### Current (with Quick Wins #1-2)
For a 2,000-page site (10× showcase):

**Debug mode (--debug):**
- Build time: ~20s (mostly rendering, scales linearly)
- Health checks: minimal (~1s)
- ✅ Usable for development

**Comprehensive mode (--profile=dev):**
- Build time: ~55s
- Health checks: ~35s (still O(n²) 😕)
- ⚠️ Slow for CI/CD

### After Quick Win #3 (batching)
For a 2,000-page site:

**Comprehensive mode (--profile=dev):**
- Build time: ~30s
- Health checks: ~8s (O(n) ✅)
- ✅ Acceptable for CI/CD
