# Template Functions Logging Implementation - Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-09  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Implementation Time:** ~1 hour  

## Summary

Successfully added structured logging and observability to Bengal's template functions, addressing a significant gap in the codebase. Template functions now use the `bengal.utils.logger` framework consistently with the rest of the system.

## Changes Made

### 1. Infrastructure (`__init__.py`)
- ✅ Added logger import and initialization
- ✅ Added debug logging for template function registration phase
- ✅ Logs module count (17 modules registered)

### 2. Data Functions (`data.py`)
**Function:** `get_data()`

Added logging for:
- ⚠️ **Warning:** Data file not found (with attempted paths)
- ⚠️ **Warning:** PyYAML not installed (with installation suggestion)
- ❌ **Error:** JSON parse errors (with line/column numbers)
- ❌ **Error:** General data load errors (with error type)
- 🐛 **Debug:** Successful data loads (format, size, key count)

**Before:**
```python
if not file_path.exists():
    return {}  # Silent failure
```

**After:**
```python
if not file_path.exists():
    logger.warning(
        "data_file_not_found",
        path=path,
        attempted=str(file_path),
        caller="template"
    )
    return {}
```

### 3. Image Functions (`images.py`)
**Functions:** `image_dimensions()`, `image_data_uri()`

Added logging for:
- ⚠️ **Warning:** Image file not found (with all attempted paths)
- ⚠️ **Warning:** Pillow not installed (with installation suggestion - one-time warning)
- ❌ **Error:** Image read errors (corrupt files, permissions, etc.)
- ❌ **Error:** Image encoding errors (data URI generation failures)
- 🐛 **Debug:** Successful operations (dimensions, format, encoding details)

**Key Improvement:**
Now distinguishes between three failure modes:
1. Pillow library not available → clear warning with solution
2. Image file not found → warning with attempted paths
3. Image corrupt/unreadable → error with context

### 4. Cross-Reference Functions (`crossref.py`)
**Functions:** `doc()`, `ref()`

Added logging for:
- ⚠️ **Warning:** Reference not found (with smart suggestions using difflib)
- 🐛 **Debug:** Successful reference resolution (path, strategy, URL)

**Key Feature:** Smart suggestions for typos
```python
logger.warning(
    "xref_not_found",
    path=path,
    strategy=lookup_strategy,
    suggestions=suggestions,  # ["docs/install", "docs/getting-started"]
    caller="template"
)
```

**Before:**
```python
if not page:
    return None  # User has no idea why it failed
```

**After:**
```python
if not page:
    suggestions = get_close_matches(path, all_refs, n=3, cutoff=0.6)
    logger.warning(
        "doc_not_found",
        path=path,
        suggestions=suggestions,  # Helpful!
        caller="template"
    )
    return None
```

### 5. Taxonomy Functions (`taxonomies.py`)
**Functions:** `popular_tags()`, `related_posts()`

Replaced debug prints with structured logging:
- 🐛 **Debug:** Popular tags computation (counts, results)
- ⚠️ **Warning:** Slow path usage for related posts (O(n²) fallback)
- 🐛 **Debug:** Fast path usage (pre-computed related posts)
- 🐛 **Debug:** Timing for slow path computations

**Key Performance Tracking:**
```python
# FAST PATH
logger.debug(
    "related_posts_fast_path",
    page=page_slug,
    precomputed_count=len(page.related_posts)
)

# SLOW PATH
logger.warning(
    "related_posts_slow_path",
    page=page_slug,
    message="Using O(n²) fallback algorithm"
)
```

**Removed:**
- ❌ All `print()` statements
- ❌ Stack trace debugging
- ❌ Hardcoded test values

## Testing

✅ **Build Test:** Showcase example builds successfully  
✅ **No Linter Errors:** All files pass linting  
✅ **Backward Compatible:** No breaking changes to API  

```bash
cd examples/showcase
bengal build
# ✨ Built 198 pages in 0.9s
```

## Log Level Strategy

Following Bengal's logging conventions:

- **DEBUG** (`logger.debug`): Normal operations, successful calls
  - File loads, successful lookups, fast path usage
  - Only visible with `--verbose` flag
  
- **WARNING** (`logger.warning`): Recoverable issues that users should know about
  - Missing files, failed lookups with suggestions
  - Slow path fallbacks, missing dependencies
  - Visible in normal build output
  
- **ERROR** (`logger.error`): Failures with context
  - Parse errors, encoding failures, corrupt files
  - Always visible, includes full error context

## Event Names

Consistent naming convention: `function_event_type`

Examples:
- `data_file_not_found`
- `image_dimensions_extracted`
- `xref_not_found`
- `related_posts_fast_path`
- `popular_tags_computed`

## Context Tags

All log events include helpful context:

```python
logger.warning(
    "xref_not_found",
    path="docs/installl",           # What was requested
    strategy="by_path",             # How we looked it up
    suggestions=["docs/install"],   # What might be correct
    caller="template"               # Where it came from
)
```

## Benefits Realized

### 1. Debugging Template Issues
**Before:** "Why is my data file not loading?"  
**After:** `⚠️ data_file_not_found path=data/authors.json attempted=/path/to/data/authors.json`

### 2. Performance Visibility
**Before:** No way to know if optimizations work  
**After:** Can track fast vs slow path usage for related posts

### 3. Helpful Error Messages
**Before:** `TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType`  
**After:** `⚠️ image_not_found path=missing.jpg tried_paths=[...]` followed by the TypeError

### 4. Build Observability
Can now analyze template function usage patterns by parsing build logs:
- Which data files are loaded most often?
- Are cross-references working or breaking?
- Is Pillow installed? Should we recommend it?

## Files Modified

1. `bengal/rendering/template_functions/__init__.py` - Added logger infrastructure
2. `bengal/rendering/template_functions/data.py` - Added comprehensive logging
3. `bengal/rendering/template_functions/images.py` - Added file/library error logging
4. `bengal/rendering/template_functions/crossref.py` - Added smart suggestions
5. `bengal/rendering/template_functions/taxonomies.py` - Replaced prints with logger

## Documentation

Created comprehensive analysis document:
- `plan/TEMPLATE_FUNCTIONS_OBSERVABILITY_ANALYSIS.md` - 600+ lines detailing gaps and solutions

## Next Steps (Optional Future Work)

### Priority 2: Performance Tracking (Not Done Yet)
Could add timing to:
- `data.py:merge()` - Deep merges on large nested dicts
- `pagination_helpers.py` - Pagination computations
- Track cross-reference index hit rates

### Priority 3: Enhanced Context (Not Done Yet)
Could add debug logging to:
- `seo.py` - Track SEO function usage
- `urls.py` - Track URL generation patterns
- `advanced_collections.py` - Track complex collection operations

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 more hours  
**Decision:** Not critical, current high-impact functions are covered

## Comparison: Before vs After

### Before
```
🐛 DEBUG popular_tags_with_site (limit=10):
   Stack: register -> render_page -> ...
   Raw tags count: 43
   Raw tags keys: ['frontmatter', 'templates', ...]
   Result (10 tags): [('templates', 7), ...]
```
(Prints to stdout, not in structured logs, always shown)

### After
```python
logger.debug(
    "popular_tags_computed",
    total_tags=43,
    limit=10,
    result_count=10
)
```
(Structured event in build logs, only in verbose mode, machine-parseable)

## Success Criteria

✅ Zero structured logging → Comprehensive observability  
✅ Silent failures → Helpful warnings with suggestions  
✅ Debug prints → Structured events  
✅ No linter errors  
✅ Backward compatible  
✅ Builds successfully  
✅ Consistent with rest of codebase  

## Lessons Learned

1. **Incremental approach works:** Did high-impact functions first, can add more later
2. **Smart suggestions are valuable:** Using `difflib.get_close_matches()` for typo detection
3. **Log levels matter:** DEBUG for normal ops, WARNING for issues users should know about
4. **Context is key:** Always include relevant paths, strategies, and suggestions
5. **Performance tracking is easy:** Simple timing with `time.time()` in slow paths

**Implementation complete and tested. Template functions now have first-class observability!** 🎉
