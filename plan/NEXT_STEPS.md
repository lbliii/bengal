# Bengal SSG: Next Steps (Realistic)

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Focus:** Make what we have solid and useful

---

## Current Status

Bengal is a **working Python static site generator** with:
- ✅ Core functionality complete
- ✅ Basic theme and templating
- ✅ Decent performance for small-medium sites
- ⚠️ Limited documentation
- ⚠️ Rough edges in UX
- ⚠️ Needs real-world validation

---

## Immediate Priorities (Ordered by Impact)

### Priority 1: Documentation

**Goal:** Make Bengal usable by someone who's never seen it

**Impact:** Critical - features don't matter if nobody knows they exist

**Tasks:**
1. Write comprehensive getting started guide
   - Installation
   - Create first site
   - Add content
   - Deploy
   
2. Configuration reference
   - All options explained
   - Examples for each
   - Common patterns
   
3. Template guide
   - Available functions
   - Template structure
   - Customization examples
   
4. Create example sites
   - Simple blog
   - Documentation site
   - Portfolio

2. **Document autodoc** - This is a killer feature!
   - How to use `bengal autodoc`
   - Configuration options
   - Example with real library
   - Comparison to Sphinx workflow

**Deliverable:** Someone can go from zero to deployed site in 30 minutes

---

### Priority 2: User Experience Polish

**Goal:** Fix rough edges and improve feedback

**Impact:** High - first impression matters

**Tasks:**
1. Better build output
   - Clear progress indicators
   - Helpful status messages
   - Build summary at end
   
2. Improved error messages
   - Show file and line number
   - Suggest fixes
   - Link to docs
   
3. Better CLI help
   - Examples in help text
   - Common workflows documented
   - Troubleshooting tips
   
4. Development workflow
   - Faster rebuilds
   - Better file watching
   - Clear reload feedback

**Deliverable:** Building sites feels smooth and helpful

---

### Priority 3: Bug Fixes & Stability

**Goal:** Address known issues and edge cases

**Impact:** High - stability builds trust

**Tasks:**
1. Fix any open bugs
2. Test edge cases
   - Empty sites
   - Sites with no tags
   - Sites with special characters
   - Large files
   - Missing files
   
3. Better error handling
   - Graceful degradation
   - Recovery suggestions
   - Don't crash on bad input
   
4. Test coverage
   - Cover common user workflows
   - Test error conditions
   - Integration tests

**Deliverable:** Bengal is stable and predictable

---

### Priority 4: Examples & Real-World Validation

**Goal:** Validate with real usage

**Impact:** Critical - theory vs practice

**Tasks:**
1. Build 2-3 complete example sites
   - Not just scaffolds
   - Real content
   - Real styling
   - Deployed somewhere
   
2. Write deployment guides
   - GitHub Pages
   - Netlify
   - Vercel
   - Self-hosted
   
3. Performance documentation
   - Honest benchmarks
   - When to use Bengal
   - When not to use Bengal
   
4. Get feedback
   - Have someone use it fresh
   - Watch them struggle
   - Fix friction points

**Deliverable:** Bengal works for real use cases

## Not Doing (At Least Not Now)

### ❌ Rust parser integration
- Too complex
- Marginal benefit
- Not requested by users

### ❌ Python autodoc / Sphinx competition
- Months of work
- Don't understand full problem space
- Not our core strength

### ❌ Advanced performance optimization
- Diminishing returns
- Current performance is acceptable
- Better to focus on UX

### ❌ Plugin system
- Premature
- No users asking for it
- Adds complexity

### ❌ Versioned documentation
- Nice to have
- Complex feature
- Not essential

---

## Success Criteria (4 weeks)

After 4 weeks, we should have:

1. ✅ **Complete documentation**
   - Getting started guide
   - Configuration reference  
   - Template guide
   - Deployment guides

2. ✅ **Better UX**
   - Clear build output
   - Good error messages
   - Helpful CLI

3. ✅ **Stable**
   - No known crashes
   - Edge cases handled
   - Good test coverage

4. ✅ **Validated**
   - 2-3 real example sites
   - Someone else used it successfully
   - Deployment guides tested

---

## How to Measure Success

### Can someone:
- ✅ Install Bengal without issues?
- ✅ Create their first site in < 10 minutes?
- ✅ Understand configuration options?
- ✅ Customize the theme?
- ✅ Deploy their site?
- ✅ Get help when stuck?

### Does Bengal:
- ✅ Build sites reliably?
- ✅ Give good error messages?
- ✅ Handle edge cases gracefully?
- ✅ Perform acceptably for target use case?
- ✅ Have clear documentation?

## Longer Term (3-6 months)

### If Bengal gains users:
1. Listen to their feedback
2. Fix their pain points
3. Add features they actually need
4. Keep it simple

### If Bengal doesn't gain users:
1. That's okay
2. At least we have good documentation
3. It's still useful for personal projects
4. We learned a lot

---

## Principles

1. **Ship small improvements frequently**
2. **Listen to real users**
3. **Keep it simple**
4. **Don't chase other tools**
5. **Be honest about capabilities**
6. **Sustainable pace**

## Current Blockers

None! All work is straightforward and unblocked.

The only constraint is time and discipline to focus on what matters.
