## 🚀 Deployment Readiness

### Current State
- ✅ Basic site structure created
- ✅ 5 cornerstone documents complete
- ✅ Configuration file ready
- ⚠️ Not yet buildable (needs remaining structure)

### To Make Buildable
- [ ] Create _index.md files for all sections
- [ ] Add getting-started stub pages
- [ ] Add core-concepts stub pages  
- [ ] Test build with `bengal build`
- [ ] Verify all cross-references work

**Estimated:** 1-2 hours to make fully buildable

---

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Priority 1: Make Site Buildable (1-2 hours)
Create minimal stub pages so the site builds successfully. This allows:
- Visual preview of what we've built
- Testing of directives rendering
- Validation that cross-references work
- Demo to stakeholders

### Priority 2: Complete Template Functions (3-4 days)
This was identified as the #1 gap. Index is done, but users need:
- Detailed docs for each of 15 modules
- Multiple examples per function
- Parameter documentation
- Edge case coverage

### Priority 3: Complete Migration Guides (2-3 days)
Hugo is done. Add:
- Jekyll migration (second most popular)
- Eleventy migration (modern alternative)
- MkDocs migration (docs-focused)

### Priority 4: Comparison Pages (2 days)
Help users choose Bengal by comparing:
- Feature matrices
- Performance benchmarks
- Use case recommendations
- Honest pros/cons

## 📝 Notes for Future Work

### Content Strategy
- **Index first, details later** - Proven successful with template functions
- **Comprehensive demos** - Kitchen sink approach works great
- **Real-world examples** - Users love practical use cases
- **Migration paths** - Critical for adoption

### Technical Approach
