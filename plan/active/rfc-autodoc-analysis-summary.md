# RFC Autodoc Alias & Inheritance Analysis Summary

## Quick Verdict

✅ **VIABLE** - Recommended to proceed with modifications

## Key Findings

### Strengths
- **Perfect architecture fit**: AST-only approach aligns with existing design
- **Low risk**: Additive changes, disabled by default
- **High value**: Closes Sphinx parity gap
- **Straightforward implementation**: ~10-15 days effort

### Challenges Identified
- Need to build class index (not complex, ~30 lines)
- Cross-module resolution limited to documented corpus (expected, documented in RFC)
- Template needs enhancements (straightforward)

### Performance Estimate
- **When disabled** (default): 0% overhead
- **When enabled**: <5% overhead (well within RFC target)
- **Index building**: <10ms for 1000 classes
- **Inherited synthesis**: ~50ms for typical codebase

## Recommended Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Alias Detection (3-5 days)
- Add `_extract_module_aliases()` method
- Update templates with alias badges
- Add basic config support
- **Low risk, high value**

### Phase 2: Inherited Members (5-7 days)
- Build class index during directory extraction
- Synthesize inherited members with metadata
- Add inherited section to templates
- **Medium risk, moderate complexity**

### Phase 3: Polish (2-3 days)
- Performance optimization
- Edge case handling
- Documentation and examples

## Key Recommendations

1. **Start simple**: Ship alias detection first (independent feature)
2. **Simplify config**: Drop per-type inheritance for MVP
3. **Document limitations**: Be clear about cross-module constraints
4. **Add benchmarks**: Measure on Bengal's own codebase
5. **Test edge cases**: Especially override detection and collision handling

## Architecture Notes

Current codebase is well-structured for this RFC:
- ✅ `DocElement.metadata` is flexible dict (no schema changes needed)
- ✅ AST parsing infrastructure mature and tested
- ✅ Template system supports conditional rendering
- ✅ Config system uses simple dict merge
- ✅ Test infrastructure ready for new scenarios

## Risk Level: LOW-MEDIUM

Main risks are around:
- Generic base class matching (can strip type params)
- Multiple inheritance edge cases (start with single inheritance)
- Performance on very large codebases (profile with benchmarks)

All risks have clear mitigations.

2. Approve RFC with modifications
3. Create implementation tasks
4. Begin Phase 1
