## Impact Analysis

### High-Impact Fixes
- **Tabs directives** - Unblocks tabbed content in documentation
- **Data table parsing** - Ensures table configuration works correctly
- **TOC extraction** - Clean table of contents without artifacts

### Code Quality
- Added backward compatibility support
- Fixed test infrastructure issues
- Improved error handling robustness
- Better method detection logic

## Next Steps (Remaining 18 Failures)

### Priority 1: Server Issues (Quick Wins - 3 tests)
- HTML/script injection logic fixes
- Component preview path resolution

### Priority 2: Utils Issues (Foundation - 5 tests)
- FileNotFoundError fixes (logger, swizzle)
- Edge case handling improvements

### Priority 3: Orchestration (Performance - 6 tests)
- Taxonomy optimization verification
- Parallel processing error handling
- Section sorting algorithm fix

### Priority 4: Integration (Complex - 2 tests)
- Page lifecycle workflow
- Incremental consistency workflow

### Priority 5: Theme/Assets (2 tests)
- Asset deduplication logic
- CLI command fixes

## Conclusion

**Solid progress**: Reduced failures by 38% (29 → 18) in one session. The rendering/parser bugs were the primary focus and are mostly resolved. The codebase is now at 99.2% test pass rate.

**Remaining work** is spread across different subsystems, with server and utils issues being the quickest wins. Integration tests may self-resolve once unit tests are fixed.

**Time invested**: ~2 hours
**Lines changed**: ~400 lines
**Files modified**: 8 files
**Tests fixed**: 11 tests
**Commits**: 6 atomic commits

The project is well on its way to 100% test pass rate.
