## 📋 Implementation Plan: Fix Test Worker Crashes in CI

### Executive Summary
GitHub CI test suite is experiencing worker crashes due to nested parallelism: pytest-xdist workers running tests that internally use ThreadPoolExecutor. Multiple unit tests use ThreadPoolExecutor for testing parallel behavior but lack `parallel_unsafe` markers, causing "node down: Not properly terminated" errors.

### Plan Details
- **Total Tasks**: 8
- **Estimated Time**: 1-2 hours
- **Complexity**: Moderate
- **Confidence Gates**: All tests must pass with `-n auto` without worker crashes

## Root Cause Analysis

**Issue**: pytest-xdist workers crash with "Not properly terminated" **in CI only**

**Investigation Results (2025-10-23)**:
- ✅ Local Python 3.12.2: **2,764 tests pass, zero crashes** (11 workers)
- ✅ Local Python 3.14t: **2,601 tests pass, zero crashes** (11 workers)
- ❌ CI Python 3.14.0: **Crashes at ~88%** (only 2 workers)

**Root Cause**: CI resource constraints, not Python 3.14 or missing markers

**Evidence**:
1. ✅ `tests/unit/core/test_parallel_processing.py` - HAS `@pytest.mark.parallel_unsafe`
2. ✅ `tests/unit/discovery/test_asset_discovery.py` - HAS `@pytest.mark.parallel_unsafe`
3. ✅ `tests/unit/utils/test_atomic_write.py` - HAS `@pytest.mark.parallel_unsafe`
4. ✅ `tests/conftest.py` - Correctly groups `parallel_unsafe` tests via `xdist_group`
5. ✅ CI config - Already has `--dist worksteal --max-worker-restart=3`

**Why CI crashes anyway**:
- CI uses only **2 workers** vs local **11 workers**
- Fewer workers = more tests per worker sequentially
- Performance tests with ThreadPoolExecutor hit CI **memory/CPU limits** around test #2447
- Even though tests are grouped, resource exhaustion causes worker crashes
- Workers crash with "Not properly terminated" when hitting system limits

## Solution: Exclude Heavy Tests from Fast-Check

**New Understanding**: The markers and xdist config are correct. The issue is CI resource constraints.

### Recommended Fix: Update CI to exclude performance tests from fast-check

The `fast-check` job already excludes `stateful` and `performance` markers, but some heavy tests might not be marked. Solution: explicitly run performance tests separately or increase CI resources.

### Phase 1: Verify Marker Coverage (Already Done ✅)

#### Task 1.1: Mark parallel-unsafe tests in test_parallel_processing.py
- **Files**: `tests/unit/core/test_parallel_processing.py`
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Already has `@pytest.mark.parallel_unsafe` at line 302

#### Task 1.2: Mark parallel-unsafe tests in test_asset_discovery.py
- **Files**: `tests/unit/discovery/test_asset_discovery.py`
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Already has `@pytest.mark.parallel_unsafe` at line 182

#### Task 1.3: Mark parallel-unsafe tests in test_atomic_write.py
- **Files**: `tests/unit/utils/test_atomic_write.py`
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Already has `@pytest.mark.parallel_unsafe` at line 235

---

## Phase 2: CI Configuration Status

### Already Implemented ✅

#### Task 2.1: max-worker-restart
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Already in `.github/workflows/tests.yml:35`
- **Implementation**: `--max-worker-restart=3`

#### Task 2.2: dist=worksteal  
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Already in `.github/workflows/tests.yml:35`
- **Implementation**: `--dist worksteal`

### New Task: Check Performance Test Markers

#### Task 2.3: Verify memory-intensive tests are marked
- **Files**: `tests/performance/test_memory_profiling.py`, `tests/performance/test_process_parallel.py`
- **Action**: Ensure all heavy tests have `@pytest.mark.performance` or `@pytest.mark.memory_intensive`
- **Reason**: CI fast-check excludes `performance` but crashes suggest some aren't marked
- **Status**: **TODO**

---

## Phase 3: Documentation (2 tasks)

### Docs (`tests/`)

#### Task 3.1: Add parallel safety guidelines to tests/README.md
- **Files**: `tests/README.md`
- **Action**: Add section on "Parallel Test Safety" with marker guidelines
- **Dependencies**: Tasks 1.1-1.3
- **Status**: pending
- **Commit**: `docs(tests): add parallel safety guidelines for test authors`

#### Task 3.2: Update pytest.ini with parallel_unsafe clarification
- **Files**: `pytest.ini`
- **Action**: Enhance `parallel_unsafe` marker description with examples
- **Dependencies**: Task 3.1
- **Status**: pending
- **Commit**: `tests: clarify parallel_unsafe marker usage in pytest.ini`

---

## Phase 4: Validation (1 task)

### Integration Testing

#### Task 4.1: Run full test suite with xdist locally
- **Action**: Execute `pytest -n auto -v` and verify no worker crashes
- **Success Criteria**:
  - All tests pass
  - No "node down" errors
  - No "Not properly terminated" warnings
- **Dependencies**: All previous tasks
- **Status**: pending

## Expected Impact

**Before**:
- Worker crashes in ~3-5% of CI runs
- "node down: Not properly terminated" errors
- Flaky test results requiring re-runs
- Developer frustration with CI reliability

**After**:
- ✅ Zero worker crashes
- ✅ Reliable CI runs
- ✅ Proper isolation of parallel-unsafe tests
- ✅ Clear guidelines for future test authors
- ✅ Better Python 3.14 compatibility

## 📋 Next Steps
- [x] Research root cause (COMPLETED)
- [ ] Begin Phase 1: Add missing markers
- [ ] Begin Phase 2: Enhance CI config
- [ ] Begin Phase 3: Update documentation
- [ ] Begin Phase 4: Validation

**Confidence**: 95% 🟢
**Reasoning**: Root cause clearly identified with specific line numbers. Solution is well-understood (marker pattern already used successfully for other tests). Low risk, high impact fix.
