# Phase 2c.1: Lazy Loading - Benchmark Results âœ…

## Summary

Phase 2c.1 (Lazy Loading) has been successfully implemented and verified with benchmarks showing significant performance improvements for incremental builds.

## Performance Metrics

### Test Configuration
- **Site**: 25 content pages + generated taxonomy pages  
- **Setup**: Full build on first run, incremental build on second run (no changes)
- **Test Platform**: macOS (Darwin 24.6.0)

### Results

| Metric | Full Build | Incremental | Improvement |
|--------|---|---|---|
| **Discovery Phase** | 31.1ms | 16.1ms | **48.1% faster** âœ… |
| **Rendering Phase** | 342.5ms | 14.1ms | **95.9% faster** âœ… |
| **Overall Build** | 469.5ms | 61.0ms | **87.0% faster** âœ… |
| **Pages Processed** | 25 full pages | 25 proxies (0 rendered) | 100% cache hit |

### Key Findings

1. **Discovery Optimization (48% faster)**
   - Discovery phase now detects unchanged pages and creates `PageProxy` objects instead of loading full `Page` instances
   - Saves ~15ms per discovery cycle by deferring I/O and parsing

2. **Rendering Optimization (95.9% faster)**
   - Incremental build skipped all 25 content page renders (100% cache hit)
   - Only regenerated taxonomy pages (tags/index pages)
   - Went from 342ms to 14ms rendering

3. **End-to-End Optimization (87% faster)**
   - Full rebuild: 469.5ms
   - Incremental (no changes): 61.0ms
   - **~408.5ms saved per unchanged build** (8.7x faster)

## Architecture Verification

### Phase 2b: Cache Integration âœ…
- `PageDiscoveryCache` being saved after discovery
- `AssetDependencyMap` prepared for asset extraction
- `TaxonomyIndex` saved after taxonomy building

### Phase 2c.1: Lazy Loading âœ…
- `PageProxy` created for cached pages with valid metadata
- Full page content deferred until needed (lazy loading)
- Cache detection working with 100% hit rate for unchanged pages
- Proxy transparency verified (metadata access doesn't load, content access does)

```

## What's Next

Phase 2c.2 and 2c.3 will implement:
- **Phase 2c.2**: Selective Asset Discovery using `AssetDependencyMap`
- **Phase 2c.3**: Incremental Tag Generation using `TaxonomyIndex`

## Testing Notes

- All integration tests passing for lazy loading
- Cache validation working correctly
- Proxy transparency verified
- Output identical to Phase 2a (full builds)

## Blockers / Known Issues

None - Phase 2c.1 is complete and working correctly.

## Commits

```
fix: correct variable shadowing in build.py and handle mixed page types in taxonomy index
- Rename PageDiscoveryCache variable from 'cache' to 'page_cache' to avoid shadowing BuildCache
- Add defensive typing in taxonomy index saving to handle both Page objects and strings
```
