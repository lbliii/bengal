# Memory Test Fixes Investigation

## Summary
Two test failures in `tests/performance/test_memory_profiling.py`:

### Issue 1: Division by Zero in `test_empty_site_memory`
**Error:** `ZeroDivisionError: integer division or modulo by zero`

**Location:** Line 66 in `site_generator` fixture
```python
pages_per_section = (page_count - 1) // sections
```

**Root Cause:** 
- `test_empty_site_memory` calls `site_generator(page_count=1, sections=0)`
- When `sections=0`, division by zero occurs
- The fixture wasn't designed to handle the "no sections" case

**Fix:** Add guard for `sections=0` case - when there are no sections, skip section creation

---

### Issue 2: Negative Threshold in `test_memory_leak_detection`
**Error:** `AssertionError: Memory leak detected: +0.2MB growth (threshold: -0.0MB)`

**Location:** Line 328 in `test_memory_leak_detection`
```python
threshold = avg_first * 0.15
```

**Root Cause:**
- RSS memory delta can be NEGATIVE (memory freed during build due to GC)
- First 3 builds averaged -0.2MB (memory was freed/cleaned up)
- Threshold becomes negative: `-0.2 * 0.15 = -0.03MB`
- Assertion `assert abs(growth) < threshold` fails because `abs(0.2) < -0.03` is False
- Can't compare absolute value to negative threshold

**Why RSS delta can be negative:**
- Python's garbage collector may free memory during build
- OS may swap out unused pages
- Shared libraries may be unloaded
- Process memory accounting can fluctuate

**Fix:** Use absolute value for threshold calculation:
```python
threshold = abs(avg_first) * 0.15
```

This ensures the threshold is always positive, making the comparison valid.

## Test Duration Analysis

**Slowest tests (from pytest --durations):**
1. `test_1k_page_site_memory`: 17.73s
2. `test_memory_scaling`: 13.20s
3. `test_memory_leak_detection`: 9.99s
4. `test_500_page_site_memory`: 8.33s
5. `test_100_page_site_memory`: 2.83s

**Total memory test time:** ~54 seconds

## Recommendations

### 1. Fix both test failures
- Handle `sections=0` case in site generator
- Use `abs()` for threshold in leak detection

### 2. Mark memory tests as slow
```python
@pytest.mark.slow
def test_memory_leak_detection(self, site_generator):
    ...
```

### 3. Run memory tests separately
```bash
# Fast tests only (default)
pytest -m "not slow"

# Include slow tests (CI/weekly/release)
pytest
```

### 4. Consider pytest execution order
- Memory tests should run last (longest duration)
- Use `pytest-xdist` for parallel execution of fast tests
- Run memory tests serially at the end

---

## Status
- [x] Investigated issues
- [x] Fix division by zero in site generator
- [x] Fix negative threshold in leak detection
- [x] Fix RSS delta assertions (use Python heap instead)
- [x] Improve leak detection methodology (skip warmup build)
- [x] Add `@pytest.mark.slow` to memory test classes
- [x] Verify all tests pass (8/8 passing)

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Division by Zero (Line 66)
```python
# Handle sections=0 case (site with only index page)
if sections == 0:
    return site_root
```

### 2. Improved Memory Leak Detection (Lines 318-349)
- Skip first build (has setup overhead)
- Compare builds 2-4 vs 8-10 instead of 1-3 vs 8-10
- Use median-based threshold (50% or 5MB minimum)
- Only fail on POSITIVE growth (negative = no leak)
- Print clearer diagnostic messages

### 3. Fixed RSS Delta Assertions
Changed from checking RSS delta (can be 0 or negative) to Python heap delta (more reliable):
```python
# Old: assert delta.rss_delta_mb > 0
# New: assert delta.python_heap_delta_mb > 0
```

### 4. Added Slow Markers
```python
@pytest.mark.slow
class TestMemoryProfiling:
    ...

@pytest.mark.slow
class TestMemoryEdgeCases:
    ...
```

## Usage

### Run fast tests only (skip memory tests)
```bash
pytest -m "not slow"
```

### Run only memory tests
```bash
pytest -m "slow"
pytest tests/performance/test_memory_profiling.py
```

### Run all tests (default)
```bash
pytest
```

## Test Results

All 8 memory tests now pass in ~52 seconds:
- ✅ test_100_page_site_memory (2.8s)
- ✅ test_500_page_site_memory (8.1s)
- ✅ test_1k_page_site_memory (16.3s)
- ✅ test_memory_scaling (13.1s)
- ✅ test_memory_leak_detection (9.6s)
- ✅ test_build_with_detailed_allocators (2.0s)
- ✅ test_empty_site_memory (0.3s)
- ✅ test_config_load_memory (0.1s)

## Key Learnings

1. **RSS memory can be negative or zero** - This is normal due to GC, OS memory management, and process accounting delays
2. **Python heap is more reliable** - Use `tracemalloc` data for assertions
3. **First build has setup overhead** - Skip it when comparing memory trends
4. **Memory measurements are noisy** - Use generous thresholds and statistical analysis
5. **Negative growth is good** - Means memory is being freed, not leaked
