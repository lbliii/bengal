## Measuring Progress

### Weekly Check-in Questions

**Week 1:**
- Can someone read the docs and build a site?
- Are all configuration options documented?
- Do we have complete example sites?

**Week 2:**
- Does the build output make sense?
- Are error messages helpful?
- Is the CLI intuitive?

**Week 3:**
- Have we fixed all known bugs?
- Do edge cases work?
- Is Bengal stable?

**Week 4:**
- Do example sites look good?
- Can someone deploy without help?
- Does a fresh user succeed?

## What We're NOT Doing

### ❌ Features
- No new major features
- No plugin system
- No autodoc
- No advanced optimization

### ❌ Infrastructure
- No CI/CD improvements (unless blocking)
- No deployment automation
- No monitoring/telemetry

### ❌ Marketing
- No blog posts
- No social media
- No launch campaign

**Just: Documentation, Polish, Validation**

---

## Potential Blockers

### None!

All work is:
- ✅ Well-defined
- ✅ Unblocked
- ✅ Achievable
- ✅ Time-boxed

The only constraint is discipline to stay focused.

## What Happens After 4 Weeks?

### If successful:
1. Bengal is well-documented and stable
2. We have proof it works (example sites)
3. We can share it with confidence
4. We iterate based on feedback

### If we fall short:
1. Extend timeline as needed
2. Cut scope if necessary
3. Focus on most critical pieces
4. Don't compromise on quality
