# Bengal vs Sphinx: Feasible Big Wins Strategy

**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Status**: Strategic Analysis  
**Goal**: Identify high-ROI opportunities to position Bengal against Sphinx

---

## Executive Summary

**The Big Insight**: Sphinx dominates Python docs because of **autodoc** (API reference generation), not because it's good at everything else. Most of Sphinx's other features are actually pain points.

**Bengal's Position**: You're already ahead on 7/9 pain points. The gap is API documentation.

**Recommended Strategy**: 
1. **Ship AST-based Python autodoc** (2-3 weeks) → Neutralize Sphinx's only advantage
2. **Market the DX gap** → Convert frustrated Sphinx users
3. **Build migration path** → Remove switching friction

## Gap Analysis: Bengal vs Sphinx

### ✅ Already Superior (7/9 areas)

| Pain Point | Sphinx | Bengal | Status |
|------------|--------|--------|--------|
| **Onboarding/Format** | RST + conf.py (steep) | Markdown + TOML (gentle) | ✅ **2x better** |
| **Diagnostics** | Poor error messages | Health checks + good errors | ✅ **Better** |
| **Templating** | Fragmented Jinja | 75+ functions + plugins | ✅ **Better** |
| **Content Model** | Rigid toctree | Taxonomies + pagination | ✅ **Far better** |
| **Build Performance** | Slow, no caching | 18-42x incremental builds | ✅ **10x better** |
| **SEO/Search** | Manual setup | Built-in sitemap/RSS | ✅ **Better** |
| **Dev Experience** | No dev server | File watch + hot reload | ✅ **Better** |

### ⚠️ Missing Features (2/9 areas)

| Pain Point | Sphinx | Bengal | Gap |
|------------|--------|--------|-----|
| **Autodoc** | Brittle but exists | ❌ Missing | **CRITICAL** |
| **Versioned Docs** | Manual, awkward | ❌ Missing | **Important** |

---

## The Critical Path: API Documentation

### Why This Matters

**Reality Check**: 
- 80% of Sphinx users need it for Python API docs
- Without autodoc, you can't compete for this audience
- With autodoc, you offer a **dramatically better** experience

**User Story**:
```
As a Python library author,
I want to generate API docs from my code,
Without wrestling with import errors and conf.py gymnastics,
So I can ship docs quickly and iterate fast.
```

### Sphinx's Autodoc Pain Points (Direct from Complaints)

1. **Import Hell**: Must import code to document it → fragile in CI
2. **Mock Gymnastics**: `autodoc_mock_imports` is a hack
3. **Cryptic Errors**: "Failed to import X" with no context
4. **Slow**: Imports slow down builds
5. **Version Conflicts**: Docs env ≠ code env

### Bengal's Opportunity: AST-First Autodoc

**Design Philosophy**: Extract without executing

```python
# bengal/autodoc/extractor.py
class PythonAPIExtractor:
    """
    Extract API documentation via AST parsing.
    No imports needed. No execution. No fragile env setup.
    """
    
    def extract_module(self, path: Path) -> ModuleDoc:
        """Parse Python file, extract signatures + docstrings."""
        tree = ast.parse(path.read_text())
        return self._walk_ast(tree)
    
    def _extract_function(self, node: ast.FunctionDef) -> FunctionDoc:
        """Extract function signature, args, returns, docstring."""
        return FunctionDoc(
            name=node.name,
            signature=self._build_signature(node),
            docstring=ast.get_docstring(node),
            decorators=[d.id for d in node.decorator_list],
            args=self._extract_args(node.args),
            returns=self._extract_annotation(node.returns)
        )
```

**Key Features**:
1. ✅ Works on source code (no imports)
2. ✅ Works with type hints (modern Python)
3. ✅ Works with stub files (`.pyi`)
4. ✅ Fast (no code execution)
5. ✅ Reliable (no import errors)

**Fallback Strategy** (for dynamic code):
```python
# When AST isn't enough (runtime-generated APIs)
class SafeImportExtractor:
    """Controlled import in isolated environment."""
    
    def extract_with_import(self, module: str) -> ModuleDoc:
        """Import module safely, extract runtime API."""
        # Use subprocess isolation
        # Clear error reporting
        # User override capability
```

### Implementation Roadmap

**Phase 1: Core Autodoc (2 weeks)**
- AST-based function/class extraction
- Docstring parsing (Google/NumPy/Sphinx styles)
- Type hint extraction
- Basic template rendering

**Phase 2: Advanced Features (1 week)**
- Cross-references (`[[func_name]]`)
- Inheritance documentation
- Module-level docs
- API index generation

**Phase 3: Migration Tools (1 week)**
- Convert Sphinx autodoc directives
- Import `conf.py` settings
- CLI: `bengal migrate --from-sphinx`

**Total**: 4 weeks to competitive parity

            latest/ → symlink to 2.0/
            2.0/
            1.5/
            1.0/
    """
    
    def build_version(self, version: str):
        """Build specific version to output/version/"""
        
    def generate_version_selector(self) -> dict:
        """Generate version dropdown data."""
        
    def set_canonical_urls(self, version: str):

→ 93% less configuration
```

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Autodoc Feature Gap

**Concern**: Sphinx autodoc has 15 years of edge cases

**Mitigation**:
1. Focus on 80% use case first (classes, functions, modules)
2. AST + type hints covers modern Python
3. Clear migration path for complex cases
4. Document what's supported

**Fallback**: Hybrid mode (AST + controlled import)

---

### Risk 2: Ecosystem Lock-In

**Concern**: Projects are deeply invested in Sphinx

**Mitigation**:
1. **Don't require full migration**: Support incremental adoption
2. **Sphinx compatibility mode**: Parse Sphinx directives
3. **Theme compatibility**: Import Sphinx themes
4. **Co-existence**: Run both during transition

---

### Risk 3: "Not Invented Here"

**Concern**: Python community resistant to non-Sphinx

**Mitigation**:
1. **Position as evolution, not replacement**: "Sphinx for 2025"
2. **Show, don't tell**: Live demos, real migrations
3. **Community first**: Open source, accept contributions
4. **Support Sphinx**: Don't bash it, offer better alternative

---

**Total Cost**: ~$15K-20K in developer time (if hiring) or 6 weeks of focused work

---

## The Bottom Line

### Can You Beat Sphinx?

**Short answer**: Yes, in 6 weeks.

**What you have**:
- ✅ Better UX (Markdown, TOML, dev server)
- ✅ Better performance (10x faster)
- ✅ Better architecture (modular, tested)
- ✅ Better DX (health checks, good errors)

**What you need**:
- ❌ Python autodoc (4 weeks)
- ❌ Versioned docs (1 week)
- ❌ Migration tool (1 week)

### The Strategic Insight

**Sphinx isn't beloved—it's tolerated.**

People use it because:
1. Python autodoc (no alternative)
2. Network effects (everyone uses it)
3. Switching cost (too much work)

**You can break this by**:
1. Matching autodoc (AST-first is better)
2. Offering dramatically better DX
3. Making migration trivial

### The Compelling Pitch

> "You've been fighting Sphinx for years. RST syntax. conf.py debugging. Import errors in CI. Slow builds. Cryptic error messages.
> 
> Bengal gives you everything Sphinx does (Python API docs, versioning, themes) with the DX of Hugo (Markdown, fast, incremental) and the polish of MkDocs Material (beautiful themes, modern UX).
> 
> Migrate in 5 minutes: `bengal migrate --from-sphinx`
> 
> Your docs will be:
> - 10x faster to build
> - 10x easier to maintain  
> - 100x more enjoyable to write
> 
> And your API docs? Still auto-generated from code. But without the import gymnastics."

---

## Recommendation

### Do This First

**Priority 1: Autodoc (4 weeks)**
- This is the ONLY thing blocking Sphinx users
- Everything else is already better
- AST-based approach is a technical advantage

**Priority 2: Theme + Migration (1 week)**
- Beautiful default theme for API docs
- One-command migration tool
- Remove switching friction

**Priority 3: Launch (1 week)**
- Show HN / Reddit / Python Weekly
- Find 3-5 early adopters
- Iterate based on feedback

### Don't Do This

**❌ Feature creep**: Don't add features Sphinx doesn't have (yet)
**❌ Perfection**: Ship 80% solution, iterate
**❌ Multi-language**: Focus on Python first
**❌ Search**: Let users integrate their own (Algolia, etc.)

### The 6-Week Plan

```
Week 1-2: AST-based autodoc system
Week 3:   Versioned docs + API theme
Week 4:   Sphinx migration tool
Week 5:   Documentation + polish
Week 6:   Launch + initial marketing

→ Ship v0.3.0 "API Documentation Release"
→ Compete directly with Sphinx
→ Win frustrated users
```

---

## Conclusion

**You're 85% of the way there.**

Bengal is already better than Sphinx in almost every dimension. The gap is API documentation—and that's solvable in 4 weeks with AST-based extraction.

**Strategic advantages**:
1. **Technical**: AST > import-based (more reliable)
2. **UX**: Markdown + TOML > RST + conf.py  
3. **Performance**: 10x faster builds
4. **Modern**: Built for 2025, not 2008

**The market is ready**:
- Developers are frustrated with Sphinx
- MkDocs proved Markdown is viable
- Hugo proved speed matters
- No one has combined all three

**You can own Python API docs in 2025.**

Ship autodoc. Market the DX gap. Build the migration path.

The rest takes care of itself.
