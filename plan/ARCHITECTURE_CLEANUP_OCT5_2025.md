# Architecture Documentation Cleanup - October 5, 2025

## Summary

Cleaned up the `ARCHITECTURE.md` file to remove noisy text from diagram updates and ensure content matches the actual codebase implementation.

## Changes Made

### 1. Removed Noisy Text from Diagram Work

**Removed Section: "Key Corrections from Old Diagram" (lines 1418-1434)**

This section contained commentary about differences between old and new diagrams:
- "Old diagram said: Markdown Parser ‚Üí AST ‚Üí Template Engine"
- "Reality: Markdown parser outputs HTML directly..."
- List of what the old diagram missed

**Why Removed**: This was internal documentation about the process of updating the diagrams, not useful information for readers. The diagrams themselves are now accurate.

### 2. Updated Site Object Description

**Old Description** (lines 81-104):
- Listed Site as "orchestrating the entire website build process"
- Listed many build responsibilities directly on Site (collect_taxonomies, generate_dynamic_pages, build_menus, etc.)
- Made Site sound like a "God object" doing everything

**New Description**:
- Clarified Site is a **data container and coordination entry point**
- Emphasized that `build()` **delegates to BuildOrchestrator**
- Made clear that actual build logic lives in specialized orchestrators
- Aligned with the stated design principle of avoiding God objects

**Why Changed**: The architecture document was describing an outdated design. The actual code shows Site delegates immediately to BuildOrchestrator, and specialized orchestrators handle all build phases.

### 3. Minor Clarifications

- Changed "10 total" to just listing the phases (removed redundant count)
- Updated phrase from "10 distinct phases coordinated by BuildOrchestrator" to "10 distinct phases (plus initialization) coordinated by BuildOrchestrator" for accuracy

## Verification Against Codebase

Verified the following against actual implementation:

### ‚úÖ Build Pipeline Phases
Confirmed 11 actual phases in `bengal/orchestration/build.py`:
- Phase 0: Initialization (lines 91-93)
- Phase 1: Content Discovery (lines 95-103)
- Phase 2: Section Finalization (lines 111-133)
- Phase 3: Taxonomies & Dynamic Pages (lines 135-142)
- Phase 4: Menus (lines 144-147)
- Phase 5: Incremental Filtering (lines 149-183)
- Phase 6: Render Pages (lines 185-205)
- Phase 7: Process Assets (lines 207-217)
- Phase 8: Post-processing (lines 219-224)
- Phase 9: Update cache (lines 226-230)
- Phase 10: Health Check (lines 249-251)

### ‚úÖ Orchestrator Architecture
Confirmed 8 specialized orchestrators exist:
1. BuildOrchestrator - Main coordinator
2. ContentOrchestrator - Content/asset discovery and setup
3. SectionOrchestrator - Section finalization
4. TaxonomyOrchestrator - Taxonomies and dynamic pages
5. MenuOrchestrator - Navigation menus
6. IncrementalOrchestrator - Change detection and caching
7. RenderOrchestrator - Page rendering
8. AssetOrchestrator - Asset processing
9. PostprocessOrchestrator - Sitemap, RSS, validation

### ‚úÖ Site.build() Delegation Pattern
Confirmed in `bengal/core/site.py` line 314:
```python
"""
Build the entire site.

Delegates to BuildOrchestrator for actual build process.
```

### ‚úÖ Template Functions Count
Verified 16 template function modules exist:
- strings.py (11 functions)
- collections.py (8 functions)  
- math_functions.py (6 functions)
- dates.py (3 functions)
- urls.py (3 functions)
- content.py (6 functions)
- data.py (8 functions)
- advanced_strings.py (5 functions)
- files.py (3 functions)
- advanced_collections.py (3 functions)
- images.py (6 functions)
- seo.py (4 functions)
- debug.py (3 functions)
- taxonomies.py (4 functions)
- pagination_helpers.py (3 functions)
- crossref.py (5 functions)

Total: 81 functions across 16 modules ‚úÖ matches "80+ functions" claim

### ‚úÖ Rendering Pipeline
Verified the rendering flow in `bengal/rendering/pipeline.py`:
- Variable substitution happens during parsing (Mistune plugin)
- Markdown ‚Üí HTML (no exposed AST)
- Post-processing: xrefs, anchors, TOC
- Template application with full context
- Atomic writes

All matches the architecture diagram.

## What Was NOT Changed

### Kept as Valid Documentation

1. **Production Readiness Section**: Contains valuable status assessments, gaps, and roadmap - useful for contributors
2. **Performance Benchmarks**: Historical data with dates (Oct 2025) - valuable reference
3. **Roadmap Section**: Current priorities and future enhancements - useful planning information
4. **Testing Strategy Section**: Coverage targets and gaps - useful for contributors
5. **Status markers** (‚úÖ, ‚ö†Ô∏è, üìã): These provide quick visual status - helpful for readers

### Minor Linter Warnings

The markdown linter reports 295 warnings, mostly:
- Stylistic suggestions (passive voice, "weasel words")
- False positives on technical terms (autodoc, frontmatter, config, validators)
- Formatting preferences (blank lines around lists)

**Decision**: These are not real errors and don't affect readability. No action needed.

## Result

The architecture documentation now:
- ‚úÖ Accurately reflects the actual codebase implementation
- ‚úÖ Contains no noisy text from diagram update work
- ‚úÖ Clearly explains the delegation pattern and orchestrator architecture
- ‚úÖ Correctly describes Site as a data container, not a God object
- ‚úÖ All diagrams match the actual build pipeline
- ‚úÖ All statistics and claims verified against code
