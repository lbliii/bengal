# Admonitions Styling Complete

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete

## Problem

Admonitions (callout boxes) were rendering correctly as HTML but had no styling, making them indistinguishable from regular content.

## Root Cause

The `admonition` Markdown extension was enabled in the parser (`bengal/rendering/parser.py`), and the HTML was being generated correctly, but there was no corresponding CSS styling for the `.admonition` classes.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Created Admonitions CSS Component

Created `/Users/llane/Documents/github/python/bengal/bengal/themes/default/assets/css/components/admonitions.css` with:

- **Base admonition styles**: Card-like appearance with border-left accent, padding, background, and subtle shadow
- **Type-specific styling** for all admonition types:
  - `note` / `info` - Blue theme with ‚ÑπÔ∏è icon
  - `tip` / `success` - Green theme with üí°/‚úÖ icons  
  - `warning` / `caution` - Amber theme with ‚ö†Ô∏è icon
  - `danger` / `error` - Red theme with üõë icon
  - `example` - Violet theme with üìù icon

- **Dark mode support**: Each type has dark theme variants with appropriate colors
- **Responsive design**: Adjusted padding/margins for mobile
- **Collapsible support**: CSS structure for expandable admonitions
- **Nested admonitions**: Proper spacing for nested callouts
- **Emoji icons**: Visual indicators in the title for each type

### 2. Integrated into Main Stylesheet

Added import to `style.css`:
```css
@import url('components/admonitions.css');
```

## Admonition Types Available

All these types are now fully styled:

```markdown
!!! note "Quick Note"
    Blue informational callout

!!! warning "Caution"  
    Amber warning callout

!!! danger "Critical Warning"
    Red danger/error callout

!!! tip "Pro Tip"
    Green tip callout

!!! example "Example"
    Violet example callout

!!! info "Information"
    Blue info callout (same as note)

!!! success "Success"
    Green success callout
```

## Design Decisions

1. **Emoji icons**: Used emoji instead of icon fonts for simplicity and universal support
2. **Border-left accent**: Visual indicator that matches the callout type
3. **Subtle backgrounds**: Light tinted backgrounds that don't overwhelm content
4. **Hover effect**: Subtle shadow increase on hover for interactivity
5. **Dark mode colors**: Carefully chosen to maintain contrast and readability

## Files Changed

- ‚úÖ Created: `bengal/themes/default/assets/css/components/admonitions.css`
- ‚úÖ Modified: `bengal/themes/default/assets/css/style.css` (added import)

## Testing

The admonitions are documented in:
- `examples/quickstart/content/docs/advanced-markdown.md`

Build output confirms CSS is being included:
- CSS file copied to `public/assets/css/components/admonitions.css`
- Import statement in compiled `public/assets/css/style.css`
