# Showcase Site Performance Analysis

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Issue:** Showcase site build taking 7-9 seconds for only 57 pages

## 🐌 Current Performance

### Build Statistics

**Sequential Mode:**
- Total: 9.05 seconds 🐌
- Rendering: 8.69 seconds (96% of total)
- Discovery: 199 ms
- Taxonomies: 0.71 ms
- Assets: 95 ms
- Postprocess: 58 ms
- Throughput: **6.3 pages/second**

**Parallel Mode:**
- Total: 7.21 seconds 🐌
- Rendering: 7.08 seconds (98% of total)
- Discovery: 9 ms
- Taxonomies: 0.66 ms
- Assets: 71 ms
- Postprocess: 44 ms
- Throughput: **7.9 pages/second**

**Parallel speedup:** Only ~20% improvement (9.05s → 7.21s)

### The Bottleneck

**Rendering phase is consuming 96-98% of build time.** All other phases are fast.

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Extremely Large Documentation Pages

The showcase site contains **massive documentation files**:

```
739 lines   function-reference/_index.md
1021 lines  function-reference/collections.md
708 lines   function-reference/dates.md
920 lines   function-reference/math.md
809 lines   function-reference/seo.md
1109 lines  function-reference/strings.md (LARGEST!)
760 lines   function-reference/urls.md
894 lines   output/output-formats.md
792 lines   markdown/kitchen-sink.md
533 lines   index.md
───────────
6,066 TOTAL (just function-reference pages!)
```

**Average page size:** ~100 lines per page  
**Large pages:** ~800 lines per page  
**Parse time:** ~124ms per page average (but larger pages take proportionally more)

### 2. Heavy Directive Usage Creating Recursive Parsing

Each file uses **many complex directives** that require recursive parsing:

**Tabs Directives per File:**
- `_index.md`: 13 tabs blocks (7 individual tabs)
- `strings.md`: 21 tabs blocks (11 individual tabs) 
- `collections.md`: 15 tabs blocks (2 individual tabs)
- `dates.md`: 11 tabs blocks (4 individual tabs)
- `math.md`: 13 tabs blocks (10 individual tabs)
- `seo.md`: 14 tabs blocks (7 individual tabs)
- `urls.md`: 12 tabs blocks (6 individual tabs)

**Total:** ~99+ tabs blocks across the function reference pages alone!

### 3. Recursive Parsing Overhead

#### How Tabs Work

From `bengal/rendering/plugins/directives/tabs.py`:

```python
def parse(self, block, m, state):
    """Parse tabs directive with nested content support."""
    content = self.parse_content(m)
    
    # Split content by tab markers: ### Tab: Title
    parts = re.split(r'^### Tab: (.+)$', content, flags=re.MULTILINE)
    
    # Parse each tab
    for i in range(start_idx, len(parts), 2):
        if i + 1 < len(parts):
            title = parts[i].strip()
            tab_content = parts[i + 1].strip()
            
            tab_items.append({
                'type': 'tab_content',
                'children': self.parse_tokens(block, tab_content, state)  # ⚠️ RECURSIVE!
            })
```

**The Problem:**
- Each `{tabs}` block calls `parse_tokens()` for EACH tab inside it
- If you have a tabs block with 10 tabs, that's 10 recursive markdown parses
- If a tab contains another directive (admonition, dropdown), that's another recursive parse
- **This creates O(n × m) complexity** where n = directives and m = avg directive size

#### Example from strings.md

```markdown
```{tabs}
### Tab: Basic Usage
[200 lines of markdown with code examples]

### Tab: Advanced
[150 lines more]

### Tab: Real World
[100 lines more]

[... 8 more tabs ...]
```
```

This single tabs block triggers **11 separate markdown parses**, each processing ~100-200 lines!

With 21 tabs blocks in strings.md, we're parsing markdown **20+ times for a single page**.

### 4. Additional Performance Factors

**Variable Substitution Plugin:**
- Runs regex pattern matching on ALL text nodes
- Pattern: `\{\{\s*([^}]+)\s*\}\}` (global search)
- With `preprocess: false`, this is disabled (good for docs pages)

**Parser Reuse:**
- Parser IS being reused per thread (thread-local storage)
- Context IS being updated efficiently (not recreating parser)
- This optimization is working correctly

**Parallel Processing:**
- Only 20% speedup suggests overhead from:
  - Thread creation/synchronization
  - GIL (Python Global Interpreter Lock) contention
  - I/O operations (file writes) serialized

## 📊 Performance Math

### Current State

```
57 pages in 7.08 seconds = 124ms per page (average)

But large pages take much longer:
- strings.md (1109 lines, 21 tabs blocks) ≈ 500-800ms
- collections.md (1021 lines, 15 tabs blocks) ≈ 400-600ms
- output-formats.md (894 lines, many directives) ≈ 400-600ms

Smaller pages:
- Simple pages (50-100 lines, no directives) ≈ 10-20ms
```

### Estimated Breakdown

```
Large documentation pages (10 files):
  10 pages × ~500ms = ~5 seconds

Generated taxonomy pages (45 files):
  45 pages × ~20ms = ~0.9 seconds

Other pages (2 files):
  2 pages × ~50ms = ~0.1 seconds

TOTAL: ~6 seconds rendering time ✓ (matches observed 7.08s)
```

**The 10 large documentation pages are consuming ~70% of total build time!**

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### Production Concerns

1. **Documentation-heavy sites will be slow**
   - API docs, function references, guides all use heavy directives
   - Each new comprehensive page adds ~500ms to build time

2. **Developer experience impact**
   - 7-9 second builds feel sluggish
   - Incremental builds help but full builds are slow
   - Hot reload in dev server is delayed

3. **Competitive disadvantage**
   - Hugo: Can build 1000+ pages in < 1 second
   - Jekyll: ~5-10 pages/second
   - **Bengal: ~8 pages/second** (but only for complex directive-heavy pages)

### Not Actually a Bug

**This is expected behavior for the content being processed:**
- 1100-line markdown files with 20+ nested directive blocks
- Each directive requires full markdown parsing of its contents
- Recursive nature of directive nesting amplifies complexity

**Similar to:**
- Compiling a massive C++ file with heavy template metaprogramming
- Rendering a complex React component tree with many effects
- Processing a deeply nested JSON document

## ✅ What's Working Well

1. **Parser reuse** - Thread-local caching avoids re-initialization
2. **Context updates** - Efficient plugin context updates per page
3. **Parallel processing** - Does provide ~20% speedup
4. **Incremental builds** - Only rebuilds changed pages
5. **Other build phases** - Discovery, taxonomies, assets all fast

## 🚀 Potential Optimizations

### Short Term (Easy Wins)

#### 1. Profile-Guided Optimization
```python
# Add timing instrumentation to identify slow directives
import cProfile
import pstats

# Profile a single large page render
```

#### 2. Directive Parsing Cache
```python
# Cache parsed directive content by content hash
directive_cache = {}

def parse(self, block, m, state):
    content = self.parse_content(m)
    content_hash = hash(content)
    
    if content_hash in directive_cache:
        return directive_cache[content_hash]
    
    # ... parse ...
    directive_cache[content_hash] = result
    return result
```

**Impact:** Could save 30-50% on pages with repeated directive patterns

#### 3. Lazy Directive Parsing
Only parse directive contents when rendering, not during initial parse:
```python
# Store unparsed content, parse on render
'children': lambda: self.parse_tokens(block, content, state)
```

**Impact:** Defers work until needed, may help with caching

#### 4. Benchmark Individual Directives
Measure exactly which directive is slowest:
- Tabs (suspected culprit)
- Admonitions
- Code-tabs
- Dropdowns

### Medium Term (Significant Work)

#### 5. Directive AST Caching
Cache the full parsed AST for directive contents:
```python
# Save parsed AST to disk, reload on next build
# Only re-parse if content changed
```

**Impact:** Huge speedup for unchanged directive-heavy pages in incremental builds

#### 6. Parallel Directive Parsing
Parse independent tabs in parallel:
```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

def parse(self, block, m, state):
    # Parse each tab in parallel
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        futures = [
            executor.submit(self.parse_tokens, block, tab_content, state)
            for tab_content in tab_contents
        ]
        children = [f.result() for f in futures]
```

**Impact:** Could speed up large tabs blocks by 2-4×

#### 7. Rust-Based Markdown Parser
Replace Python Mistune with a Rust parser (via PyO3):
- commonmark-rs
- pulldown-cmark

**Impact:** Could be 10-50× faster parsing, but:
- Major integration work
- Lose Mistune's Python plugin API
- Would need to rewrite all directives

### Long Term (Architectural)

#### 8. Separate Content Types
```toml
[content_types]
"docs/function-reference/*" = "api-reference"  # Heavy directives expected
"blog/*" = "simple"  # Fast path, minimal processing
```

**Impact:** Optimize different content types differently

#### 9. Streaming/Incremental Rendering
Render page sections independently and stream to output:
- Parse page in chunks
- Render sections as they're ready
- Write output incrementally

**Impact:** Perceived faster builds, better progress feedback

#### 10. Build Output Caching
Cache rendered HTML for unchanged directive blocks:
```python
# If directive content unchanged, use cached HTML
# Skip re-parsing and re-rendering
```

**Impact:** Massive speedup for incremental builds

## 🎲 Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **✅ Accept current performance as reasonable** for directive-heavy content
   - 7-9 seconds for 57 complex pages is not terrible
   - ~124ms per page average is acceptable
   - Incremental builds will be fast (only rebuild changed pages)

2. **📝 Document performance expectations**
   - Add warning in docs about directive performance
   - Recommend limiting nested directives for large pages
   - Suggest splitting massive pages into multiple smaller pages

3. **🔧 Fix the `truncatewords` error**
   - Add missing filter to template engine
   - Currently causing build warning

4. **📊 Add detailed timing to identify bottleneck**
   ```python
   # In RenderingPipeline.process_page()
   if verbose:
       print(f"  {page.source_path}: {elapsed_ms:.1f}ms")
   ```

### Follow-Up Investigations

5. **🔬 Profile a single large page render**
   - Run cProfile on strings.md render
   - Identify exact bottleneck (tabs parsing? regex? AST building?)
   - Make data-driven optimization decisions

6. **🧪 Benchmark directive parsing cache**
   - Implement simple content-hash based cache
   - Measure impact on build time
   - If >20% improvement, make permanent

7. **📈 Compare with simplified showcase**
   - Create version without heavy directives
   - Measure speedup
   - Document the cost of directive complexity

### Future Enhancements

8. **Consider Rust parser evaluation** (see `plan/PYO3_RUST_PARSER_EVALUATION.md`)
9. **Implement directive AST caching** for incremental builds
10. **Add build performance dashboard** to track metrics over time

## 📝 Conclusion

### The Bottom Line

**The showcase site is slow because it's doing a LOT of work:**
- Processing 6000+ lines of complex markdown
- Parsing 100+ nested directive blocks
- Each directive triggers recursive markdown parsing
- This creates multiplicative complexity

**This is not a bug, it's the expected cost of rich directive features.**

### Trade-offs

**What we gain:**
- Beautiful, feature-rich documentation
- Tabs, admonitions, code examples, nested content
- Single-source content reuse
- Excellent UX for readers

**What we pay:**
- ~124ms per complex page
- 7-9 seconds for full site build
- Incremental builds help but full builds are slow

### Is This Acceptable?

**For the showcase site: Yes** ✓
- It's a documentation site (one-time build)
- Incremental builds will be fast for iterative dev
- 7-9 seconds is reasonable for 57 complex pages

**For production sites:**
- **Simple content:** Very fast (10-20ms per page)
- **Medium complexity:** Fast (50-100ms per page)
- **Heavy directives:** Slower but acceptable (200-500ms per page)

**Recommendation:** Document this clearly and provide guidance on directive usage.

## 🐛 Current Issues to Fix

1. **Missing `truncatewords` filter warning**
   - File: `function-reference/_index.md`
   - Error: `No filter named 'truncatewords'`
   - Fix: Register filter in template engine

2. **Parallel mode not selected**
   - Config has `parallel = true`
   - Build shows "Mode: sequential"
   - Fix: Check why parallel flag isn't propagating
