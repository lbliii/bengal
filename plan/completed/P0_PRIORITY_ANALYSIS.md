# P0 Priority Analysis: What to Build Next

**Date**: October 4, 2025  
**Context**: Resource management shipped, what's the highest ROI next?

---

## üéØ The Winner: Atomic Writes (Reliability)

**ROI Score**: 95/100 üèÜ

### Why This is P0

**1. Data Loss Prevention** (Critical)
- **Current risk**: Crash during build = corrupted site
- **User impact**: Hours of work lost, broken production sites
- **Frequency**: Every build is at risk
- **Severity**: CRITICAL - only thing that causes data loss

**2. Quick Implementation** (1 day)
```python
# Simple pattern, apply everywhere
def atomic_write(path, content):
    tmp = f"{path}.tmp"
    with open(tmp, 'w') as f:
        f.write(content)
    os.replace(tmp, path)  # Atomic on POSIX
```

**3. Invisible Infrastructure**
- Users won't notice when it works (good!)
- They WILL notice when it's missing (disasters)
- Foundation for crash recovery later

**4. High Confidence**
- Well-understood problem
- Standard solution
- Easy to test
- No edge cases

### Implementation Plan

**Effort**: 1 day  
**Files to change**: 3-4  
**Risk**: Very low

```python
# bengal/utils/atomic_write.py (NEW)
def atomic_write(path: Path, content: str) -> None:
    """Write file atomically (crash-safe)."""
    tmp_path = path.with_suffix(path.suffix + '.tmp')
    try:
        tmp_path.write_text(content, encoding='utf-8')
        tmp_path.replace(path)  # Atomic!
    except Exception:
        tmp_path.unlink(missing_ok=True)  # Cleanup on failure
        raise

# Update in 3 places:
# 1. bengal/rendering/pipeline.py - page writes
# 2. bengal/orchestration/asset.py - asset copies  
# 3. bengal/postprocess/*.py - sitemap/rss writes
```

**Testing**:
```python
def test_atomic_write_crash():
    # Kill process mid-write
    # Verify: old file intact OR new file complete
    # Never: partial/corrupted file
```

## ü•à Runner-Up: Structured Logging (Observability)

**ROI Score**: 85/100

### Why This is Important

**1. Developer Experience**
- **Current pain**: No visibility into what's happening
- **Impact**: Hard to debug user issues
- **Frequency**: Every development session
- **Severity**: HIGH - slows down all future work

**2. Foundation for Everything**
- Enables metrics
- Enables performance profiling
- Enables telemetry
- Enables progress bars
- Enables debugging at scale

**3. Medium Implementation** (2-3 days)
```python
# Setup structured logging
import logging
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()

# Throughout codebase:
logger.info("page_rendered", 
    page=page.path,
    duration=elapsed,
    template=template_used
)
```

**4. Visible Impact**
- Users immediately see better output
- Makes Bengal feel more professional
- Enables `--log-level` flag

### Implementation Plan

**Effort**: 2-3 days  
**Files to change**: 15-20 (replace prints)  
**Risk**: Low (backwards compatible)

```python
# bengal/utils/logging.py (NEW)
def setup_logging(level='INFO', log_file=None):
    """Configure structured logging."""
    # Setup structlog with:
    # - Console output (colored)
    # - File output (JSON)
    # - Log levels
    # - Context binding

# Add to CLI:
@click.option('--log-level', default='INFO')
@click.option('--log-file', type=click.Path())
def build(log_level, log_file, ...):
    setup_logging(level=log_level, log_file=log_file)
```

## ü•â Quick Win: Progress Bars (Observability subset)

**ROI Score**: 75/100

### Why This is Nice

**1. User Experience**
- **Current pain**: Silent for 5-10 seconds on large builds
- **Impact**: Users think it's frozen
- **Frequency**: Every build
- **Severity**: MEDIUM - cosmetic but visible

**2. Very Quick** (1 day)
```python
from rich.progress import Progress

with Progress() as progress:
    task = progress.add_task("Rendering pages", total=len(pages))
    for page in pages:
        render(page)
        progress.update(task, advance=1)
```

**3. High Visibility**
- Users immediately see the improvement
- Makes Bengal feel modern
- Low risk

## üéØ Recommended P0: Atomic Writes

### The Case

**Risk vs Reward**:
- Current: Every build risks data corruption
- Solution: 1 day of work
- Result: 100% crash-safe writes

**Compounding Benefits**:
1. Immediate safety improvement
2. Unlocks crash recovery later
3. Enables checkpoint system
4. Required for production readiness

**User Story**:
```
As a user,
When my build crashes (power loss, OOM, etc),
I want my site to be intact (old or new, not corrupted),
So I don't lose hours of work.
```

**Current Behavior** (BAD):
```bash
$ bengal build
Rendering pages... [CRASH]
$ ls public/
index.html      # Partially written, corrupted!
about.html      # Old version
contact.html    # Missing (never started)
```

**With Atomic Writes** (GOOD):
```bash
$ bengal build
Rendering pages... [CRASH]
$ ls public/
index.html      # Old version (intact!)
about.html      # Old version (intact!)
contact.html    # Old version (intact!)
# Or all new if crash happened after successful writes
```

## üö´ What NOT to Do First

### ‚ùå Plugin System (Too Complex)
- **Effort**: 7+ days
- **Risk**: High (API design)
- **ROI**: Medium (few users need it immediately)
- **Blocker**: None
- **Verdict**: Wait until v0.4.0

### ‚ùå Crash Recovery (Needs Foundation)
- **Effort**: 5+ days
- **Risk**: Medium
- **Dependency**: Requires atomic writes first
- **ROI**: Lower than prerequisites
- **Verdict**: v0.3.0 or v0.4.0

### ‚ùå Telemetry (Not Critical)
- **Effort**: 3+ days
- **Risk**: Medium (privacy concerns)
- **ROI**: Low for current stage
- **Verdict**: v0.5.0 or later

## üí° Why Atomic Writes Beat Logging

This is the key tradeoff. Here's why atomic writes wins:

### Severity: Data Loss vs Inconvenience
- **Atomic writes**: Prevents **data loss** (worst possible outcome)
- **Logging**: Improves **debugging** (nice to have)

### Frequency: Always vs Sometimes
- **Atomic writes**: Every build is at risk
- **Logging**: Only matters when debugging

### User Impact: Silent Crisis vs Visible Annoyance
- **Atomic writes**: Invisible until disaster strikes
- **Logging**: Users complain about lack of progress

### Foundation: Enables Future vs Improves Present
- **Atomic writes**: Required for crash recovery, checkpoints
- **Logging**: Makes development easier

### Risk: Bomb vs Paper Cut
- **Atomic writes**: Ticking time bomb (will explode)
- **Logging**: Paper cut (annoying but not critical)

### The Analogy
**Atomic writes** = Wearing a seatbelt  
**Logging** = Installing a nice stereo

Which do you do first? üöó

## üéì The Meta-Lesson

**P0 isn't always the flashiest feature.**

- Progress bars are more visible ‚ú®
- Plugin system is more exciting üöÄ
- Telemetry is more interesting üìä

**But atomic writes prevent disasters.** üí£

This is the difference between:
- **Feature-driven development** (what users ask for)
- **Foundation-driven development** (what systems need)

Great tools do both, but **foundation comes first**.
