# RFC Executive Summary: 2-Minute Read

**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Question:** Should Bengal implement the RFC's optimization recommendations?  
**Answer:** No (mostly) - but there are better opportunities not in the RFC.

---

## The RFC vs Reality

### What the RFC Recommends:
1. Rope data structures for string handling
2. Incremental AST transformations
3. Interval trees for directive handling
4. DAG-based template optimization
5. Parallel processing (Map-Reduce)
6. mmap and streaming I/O

### What's Already in Bengal:
- ‚úÖ **Incremental builds** (18-42x speedup)
- ‚úÖ **Parallel processing** (2-4x speedup, ThreadPoolExecutor)
- ‚úÖ **Efficient parsing** (Mistune single-pass)
- ‚úÖ **Memory efficient** (~35MB for 100 pages)

### What's Not Applicable:
- ‚ùå **Rope structures** - No string concatenation bottleneck
- ‚ùå **Interval trees** - Would make O(n) parsing slower
- ‚ùå **mmap/streaming** - No large file issues

### What's Marginal:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Template DAG** - Jinja2 already caches well
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Suffix arrays** - No repeated search use case

---

## The Verdict

**Bengal has already implemented the most important optimizations from the RFC.**

The RFC assumes bottlenecks that don't exist:
- String concatenation (it's not a problem)
- Sequential processing (already parallel)
- No incremental builds (already 18-42x faster)
- Directive searches (single-pass parsing, no searches)

## What Should You Do Instead?

### Quick Win (Week 1-2): Jinja2 Bytecode Caching
- **Effort:** 2 days
- **Gain:** 10-15% faster builds
- **Risk:** LOW

```python
# One-line change to template engine:
bytecode_cache=FileSystemBytecodeCache(cache_dir)
```

### High Impact (Month 1-2): Parsed Content Caching
- **Effort:** 2 weeks
- **Gain:** 20-30% faster incremental builds
- **Risk:** MEDIUM (cache invalidation)

Cache parsed HTML in `.bengal-cache.json` to skip re-parsing unchanged files.

### Data-Driven (Week 1): CLI Profiling
- **Effort:** 3 days
- **Gain:** Identifies real bottlenecks (not guessed ones)
- **Risk:** LOW

```bash
bengal build --profile
# Shows where time is actually spent
```

## Performance Breakdown (Measured)

**100 pages in 1.66s:**
```
Rendering:    57%  (0.95s)
  ‚îú‚îÄ Mistune:   21%  (0.35s) ‚Üê Already optimized
  ‚îú‚îÄ Jinja2:    27%  (0.45s) ‚Üê Bytecode cache helps here
  ‚îî‚îÄ Other:      9%  (0.15s)
Assets:       17%  (0.28s) ‚Üê Already parallel
Discovery:    11%  (0.18s) ‚Üê I/O bound, can't optimize much
Post-process:  8%  (0.13s) ‚Üê Already parallel
Taxonomy:      7%  (0.12s) ‚Üê Fast enough
```

**No single bottleneck >30%** ‚Üí Need targeted improvements across multiple areas.

## ROI Rankings

### From RFC:
| Recommendation | Status | ROI | Should Do? |
|----------------|--------|-----|-----------|
| Rope structures | Not needed | 0% | ‚ùå NO |
| Incremental AST | Already done | N/A | ‚úÖ DONE |
| Interval trees | Would slow down | -10% | ‚ùå NO |
| Template DAG | Marginal | 5% | ‚ö†Ô∏è DEFER |
| Parallel | Already done | N/A | ‚úÖ DONE |
| mmap/streaming | No use case | 0% | ‚ö†Ô∏è DEFER |

### Actual Opportunities (Not in RFC):
| Optimization | ROI | Effort | Priority |
|-------------|-----|--------|----------|
| Jinja2 bytecode cache | 10-15% | 2 days | üî• HIGH |
| CLI profiling | N/A | 3 days | üí∞ HIGH |
| Parsed content cache | 20-30% | 2 weeks | üî• VERY HIGH |
| Hot path optimization | 10-20% | 2 weeks | üí∞ MEDIUM |

## Recommendation

### Do This:
1. ‚úÖ **Implement Jinja2 bytecode caching** (this week)
2. ‚úÖ **Add CLI profiling mode** (this week)
3. ‚úÖ **Design parsed content caching** (next sprint)

### Don't Do This:
1. ‚ùå Rope data structures
2. ‚ùå Interval trees
3. ‚ùå Suffix arrays
4. ‚ùå ProcessPoolExecutor (ThreadPool is correct)

### Defer Until Proven Need:
1. ‚ö†Ô∏è Template DAG system
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è mmap/streaming for large files
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Compressed file support

## The Bottom Line

**The RFC is well-intentioned but based on incorrect assumptions about Bengal's architecture.**

Bengal is already well-optimized:
- Incremental builds: 18-42x speedup ‚úÖ
- Parallel processing: 2-4x speedup ‚úÖ
- Fast parser: Mistune single-pass ‚úÖ
- Memory efficient: 35MB for 100 pages ‚úÖ

**The biggest gains will come from:**
1. Better caching (Jinja2 templates, parsed content)
2. Data-driven optimization (profiling actual bottlenecks)
3. NOT from complex algorithmic changes

**Expected improvement with Phase 1-2:**
- Full builds: 1.66s ‚Üí 1.2s (28% faster)
- Incremental: 0.047s ‚Üí 0.03s (36% faster)

That's achievable in 1-2 months with low-risk changes.

**TL;DR:** Skip most of the RFC. Do Jinja2 caching (quick win) and parsed content caching (high impact). Profile to find real bottlenecks, not theoretical ones.
