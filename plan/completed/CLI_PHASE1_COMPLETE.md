## 🐛 Issues Encountered & Resolved

### Issue 1: TERM=dumb blocking rich output
**Solution:** Made detection less conservative - rich handles simple terminals gracefully

### Issue 2: Progress bars not showing by default
**Solution:** Changed `quiet` default from `True` to `False` - progress is visual feedback, not verbose logging

### Issue 3: Fast builds make progress hard to see
**Solution:** This is actually a feature! Bengal is TOO FAST ⚡ Progress shows for slower builds.
