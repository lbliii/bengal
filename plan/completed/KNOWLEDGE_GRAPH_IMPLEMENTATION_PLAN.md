### Phase 4: Health Check Integration (Quality)

**Goal:** Surface graph insights in health checks

**Features:**
1. New validator: `ConnectivityValidator`
   ```python
   class ConnectivityValidator(BaseValidator):
       """Validate site connectivity and structure."""
       
       def validate(self, site: Site) -> CheckResult:
           graph = KnowledgeGraph(site)
           graph.build()
           
           issues = []
           
           # Find orphaned pages
           orphans = [p for p in site.pages 
                     if graph.incoming_refs[id(p)] == 0]
           if orphans:
               issues.append({
                   'level': 'warning',
                   'message': f'{len(orphans)} pages have no incoming links',
                   'pages': [p.url for p in orphans[:5]]
               })
           
           # Find over-connected pages
           super_hubs = [p for p in site.pages 
                        if graph.incoming_refs[id(p)] > 50]
           if super_hubs:
               issues.append({
                   'level': 'info',
                   'message': f'{len(super_hubs)} pages are heavily referenced (consider splitting)',
                   'pages': [p.url for p in super_hubs]
               })
           
           return CheckResult(
               validator='connectivity',
               passed=len(orphans) == 0,
               issues=issues
           )
   ```

2. Integration with `--profile=dev`
   - ConnectivityValidator runs automatically
   - Results in health check report

3. Configuration options in `bengal.toml`
   ```toml
   [health.connectivity]
   enabled = true
   warn_orphans = true
   orphan_threshold = 0  # Pages with <= N incoming refs

## 🚀 Phase 5: Reader-Facing Graph (Future Enhancement)

**Goal:** Make knowledge graph available to site visitors as a navigation tool

### User Stories: Site Readers/Visitors

**"As a reader visiting a documentation site, I want to..."**

1. ✅ Explore the entire site visually
   - *Problem:* Traditional nav menus hide structure, search is linear
   - *Solution:* Interactive graph shows "the map" of all content
   - *Impact:* Better discovery, understanding of scope

2. ✅ Find related content by proximity
   - *Problem:* "Related posts" are algorithm-driven, not visual
   - *Solution:* See which pages cluster together (by tags, links)
   - *Impact:* Serendipitous discovery

3. ✅ Navigate non-linearly
   - *Problem:* Most sites force linear navigation (prev/next, breadcrumbs)
   - *Solution:* Click any node to jump to that content
   - *Impact:* Matches how knowledge actually connects

**Real-World Examples:**
- **Documentation:** "Show me all API endpoints and how they relate"
- **Blog:** "What posts are in the Python cluster vs. JavaScript cluster?"
- **Knowledge Base:** "What's the structure of troubleshooting content?"
- **Digital Garden:** "Show me the entire garden layout"

### Implementation Approach

**Option 1: Static Embedded Graph**
```html
<!-- In page template -->
<div class="page-content">
  {{ content }}
</div>

<aside class="knowledge-graph-widget">
  <h3>Explore Related Content</h3>
  <div id="mini-graph"></div>
  <script>
    // Show 2-hop neighborhood around current page
    renderMiniGraph(currentPage, radius=2);
  </script>
</aside>
```

**Option 2: Full-Site Exploration Page**
```
yoursite.com/explore/
  └─> Full interactive graph of entire site
  └─> Current page highlighted
  └─> Click to navigate
```

**Option 3: Configurable Widget**
```toml
# bengal.toml
[features.knowledge_graph]
enabled = true
reader_facing = true
mode = "full"  # or "mini" or "disabled"
show_orphans = false  # Hide pages with 0 refs from reader view
show_drafts = false   # Exclude draft pages
max_nodes = 500       # Performance limit
```

### Features for Readers

**1. Filtered Views**
```javascript
// Show only pages matching reader's interest
filterByTag('python')
filterBySection('tutorials')
filterByType('blog-post')
```

**2. Search Integration**
```javascript
// Highlight search results in graph
searchAndHighlight('authentication')
// Shows all pages mentioning "authentication" AND their connections
```

**3. Path Finding**
```javascript
// "How do I get from A to B?"
showShortestPath(fromPage, toPage)
// Highlights the conceptual path through content
```

**4. Reading Progress**
```javascript
// Mark pages reader has visited
markAsRead(pageUrl)
// Shows what's been explored vs. unexplored
```

### Technical Considerations

**Performance:**
- Large sites (>1K pages) need filtered views for readers
- Option to generate separate graphs per section
- Progressive loading (show nearby nodes first, expand on demand)

**Privacy:**
- No tracking without consent
- Reading progress stored locally (localStorage)
- Can be disabled entirely

**SEO:**
- Graph data as JSON-LD for search engines
- Helps Google understand site structure
- Breadcrumb + graph = comprehensive navigation signals

**Accessibility:**
- Keyboard navigation through graph
- Screen reader friendly (list view fallback)
- High contrast mode support

### Configuration Example

```toml
# bengal.toml
[features.knowledge_graph]
# Creator-facing features (dev/build time)
enabled = true
show_stats = true
generate_viz = true
optimize_memory = true

# Reader-facing features (site visitors)
reader_mode = "full"  # "full", "mini", "section", "disabled"
reader_max_nodes = 500
reader_show_orphans = false
reader_enable_search = true
reader_enable_filters = true
reader_store_progress = true  # localStorage for visited pages

# Appearance
node_color_by = "type"  # "type", "tag", "section", "date"
default_layout = "force"  # "force", "hierarchical", "radial"
theme = "auto"  # "auto", "light", "dark"
```

### Real-World Use Cases

**Documentation Site (Kubernetes docs):**
```
Reader view: Full graph with sections as clusters
   ├─ "Getting Started" cluster (green)
   ├─ "API Reference" cluster (blue)
   ├─ "Concepts" cluster (yellow)
   └─ "Tasks" cluster (orange)

Reader benefit: See entire scope, jump between sections visually
```

**Personal Blog (Tech blog):**
```
Reader view: Mini graph sidebar on each post
   ├─ Shows current post (highlighted)
   ├─ Shows related posts (1-hop away)
   └─ Click to navigate to related content

Reader benefit: Discover related posts visually, not just via algorithm
```

**Digital Garden (Andy Matuschak style):**
```
Reader view: Graph IS the primary navigation
   ├─ Landing page shows full graph
   ├─ Hover to preview content
   ├─ Click to read full page
   └─ Page content shown as overlay/sidebar

Reader benefit: Non-linear exploration, matches thought structure
```

**Educational Content (Course materials):**
```
Reader view: Hierarchical graph showing prerequisites
   ├─ Lesson 1 → Lesson 2 → Lesson 3
   ├─ Visual progress tracking (completed nodes in green)
   └─ Locked nodes until prerequisites completed

Reader benefit: Clear learning path, visual progress
```

## 🎨 User Experience Design

### CLI Design Principles

**1. Progressive Disclosure**
```bash
# Basic: Just see the graph
bengal graph

# Intermediate: Get detailed stats
bengal graph --stats

# Advanced: Generate visualization
bengal graph --output public/graph.html

# Power user: Integrate with build
bengal build --profile=dev [auto-includes graph]
```

**2. Sensible Defaults**
- `bengal graph` without flags → shows stats
- Auto-enable memory optimization for sites > 5K pages
- Graph visualization uses site theme colors

**3. Clear Feedback**
```bash
$ bengal graph --stats

📊 Analyzing site structure...
   └─ Building dependency graph...     [======    ] 60%
   └─ Computing connectivity scores... [==========] 100%

[Results displayed]
```

---

### Visual Design (Graph Visualization)

**Color Scheme:**
- Hubs (>10 refs): Blue (important)
- Mid-tier (3-10): Gray (normal)
- Leaves (0-2): Light gray (peripheral)
- Orphans (0 refs): Red (attention needed)

**Size:**
- Node size ∝ incoming references
- Min size: 10px, Max size: 50px

**Interactions:**
- Hover → Show title and stats
- Click → Navigate to page
- Drag → Reposition node
- Zoom → Mouse wheel
- Search → Filter nodes by title/tag

**Layout:**
- Force-directed (automatic clustering)
- Tagged pages cluster together
- Hubs naturally gravitate to center
