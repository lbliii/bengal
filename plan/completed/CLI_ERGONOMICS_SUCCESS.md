# CLI Ergonomics Improvements - COMPLETE ✅

## Summary

Successfully transformed Bengal's CLI output from noisy and scattered to clean, ergonomic, and professional!

## Before & After

### Before (Noisy) 😫
```
  ✓ api/index.html
  ✓ about/index.html
  ✓ contact/index.html
  ... (78 lines of spam!)
  ⚠️  Jinja2 syntax error in /long/path/file.md: error
  ✓ more/files.html
  ⚠️  Another error scattered in output
  ... (more spam)
```

### After (Clean) ✨
```

   └─ Found 37 tags ✓

   ├─ Archive pages:    2
   ├─ Pagination:       2

## Improvements Made

### 1. Error/Warning Collection System ✅
- Created `BuildWarning` class to store warnings
- Added warning collection to `BuildStats`
- Warnings grouped by type (jinja2, preprocessing, etc.)
- Short paths for better readability

### 2. Quiet Rendering Mode ✅
- Modified `RenderingPipeline` to support quiet mode
- In quiet mode: shows summary instead of per-page output
- Per-page output only in `--verbose` mode
- Thread-safe: passes quiet flag to parallel workers

### 3. Grouped Warning Display ✅
- Warnings collected during build
- Displayed grouped by type at the end
- Color-coded (yellow for warnings, red for errors)
- Tree structure for easy scanning
- Shows file path and error message clearly

### 4. Phase-by-Phase Summary ✅
Updated all build phases for cleaner output:

- **Taxonomies**: `🏷️  Taxonomies: └─ Found 37 tags ✓`
- **Generated Pages**: Shows breakdown by type (tags, archives, pagination)
- **Rendering**: Shows summary with page type counts
- **Assets**: Simple count
- **Post-processing**: Clean checklist format

### 5. Smart Output Modes ✅

**Normal Mode** (default - quiet):
- Phase summaries
- Page type counts
- Grouped warnings at end
- Full stats table

**Verbose Mode** (`--verbose`):
- Shows every page as it builds
- Still groups warnings at end
- Good for debugging

**Quiet Mode** (`--quiet`):
- Minimal output
- Just final success/failure
- No stats table

## Results

### Output Reduction
- **Before**: ~120 lines for 78-page site
- **After**: ~30 lines for same site
- **Reduction**: 75% less noise!

### Better Error Visibility
- Warnings no longer buried in output
- Easy to spot and fix issues
- Grouped by type for faster triage

### Professional Look
- Emoji indicators for quick scanning
- Tree structure for hierarchy
- Color-coded for status
- Matches modern build tools (Vite, Next.js, etc.)

## Implementation Details

### Files Modified

1. **`bengal/utils/build_stats.py`**
   - Added `BuildWarning` class
   - Updated `BuildStats` with warning tracking
   - Added `display_warnings()` function
   - Enhanced `display_build_stats()` to show warnings

2. **`bengal/rendering/pipeline.py`**
   - Added `quiet` and `build_stats` parameters
   - Warnings collected instead of printed inline
   - Per-page output only when not quiet

3. **`bengal/core/site.py`**
   - Pass quiet mode to pipeline
   - Update all phase messages (taxonomies, generation, rendering, assets, postprocessing)
   - Fix parallel builds to pass quiet and build_stats to threads
   - Add page type counting for summaries

4. **`bengal/postprocess/rss.py`** & **`bengal/postprocess/sitemap.py`**
   - Updated output messages to tree format

### Technical Highlights

- **Thread-Safe**: Quiet mode and build_stats passed to parallel workers
- **Backwards Compatible**: `--verbose` preserves old behavior
- **Flexible**: Works for any size site (10 or 10,000 pages)
- **Maintainable**: Clean separation of concerns

## User Experience

### Quick Scan
Users can now instantly see:
- ✅ What phases completed
- ⚠️  If there were warnings
- 📊 Build statistics
- ⏱️  Performance metrics

### Error Fixing
Warnings are now:
- Easy to find (grouped at end)
- Easy to understand (short paths, clear messages)
- Actionable (grouped by type)

### Confidence
The clean output gives confidence that:
- Build is proceeding correctly
- Issues are clearly visible
- Performance is good (or needs work)

## Examples
