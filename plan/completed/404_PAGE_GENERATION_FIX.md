# 404 Page Generation Fix

**Date:** October 4, 2025  
**Status:** âœ… Complete

---

## Problem

The 404 page template existed in the theme (`bengal/themes/default/templates/404.html`) and properly extended `base.html`, but the actual `404.html` file was never generated during the build process. Users would get an unstyled or missing 404 page when accessing non-existent URLs.

### Root Cause

There was no mechanism in the build orchestration to generate special pages (404, search, etc.) that don't have corresponding markdown source files. The template existed but was never rendered.

---

## Solution

### 1. Created Special Pages Generator

Added new module `bengal/postprocess/special_pages.py` that:
- Generates special pages from templates without markdown source
- Renders 404 page with full site context (navigation, theme, etc.)
- Can be extended for other special pages (search, etc.)

**Key features:**
- Reuses site's template engine (with all registered functions)
- Creates minimal page context for template rendering
- Gracefully handles missing templates
- Writes to output directory atomically

### 2. Integrated into Build Pipeline

Updated `bengal/orchestration/postprocess.py` to:
- Always generate special pages during postprocessing
- Run in parallel with other postprocess tasks
- Report success/failure in build output

### 3. Updated Module Exports

Updated `bengal/postprocess/__init__.py` to export the new `SpecialPagesGenerator`.

---

## Files Changed

1. **bengal/postprocess/special_pages.py** (NEW)
   - SpecialPagesGenerator class
   - 404 page generation logic

2. **bengal/orchestration/postprocess.py**
   - Added special pages task to postprocessing
   - Added `_generate_special_pages()` method

3. **bengal/postprocess/__init__.py**
   - Added SpecialPagesGenerator to exports

---

## Result

### Build Output

```
ðŸ”§ Post-processing:
   â”œâ”€ RSS feed âœ“
   â”œâ”€ Sitemap âœ“
   âœ“ Special pages: 404
   â””â”€ Output formats: JSON, LLM text, index.json âœ“
```

### Generated 404 Page Includes

âœ… **Full base layout from theme**
- DOCTYPE and proper HTML structure
- All meta tags (OpenGraph, Twitter, etc.)
- Canonical URLs

âœ… **Header with navigation**
- Site logo/title
- Main navigation menu with active states
- Theme toggle (dark/light mode)
- Mobile navigation support

âœ… **Styled error content**
- Large "404" error code
- Helpful error message
- Action buttons (Go Home, View Posts)
- Suggestions list with links

âœ… **Footer**
- Popular tags widget
- Copyright notice
- Footer navigation links

âœ… **All functionality**
- CSS stylesheet loaded
- JavaScript loaded (theme toggle, mobile nav, etc.)
- Responsive design
- Accessibility features

---

## Testing

Tested on `examples/quickstart`:
- Build successful
- 404.html generated in public/
- File size: ~11KB (fully styled)
- Served correctly via HTTP
- All navigation and theme features work

---

## Benefits

1. **Better UX**: Users who hit 404 errors can easily navigate back to valid pages
2. **Consistent branding**: 404 page matches site's theme and style
3. **SEO**: Proper meta tags and structure on error pages
4. **Deployment-ready**: Production-ready 404 pages for all hosting platforms

---

## Future Extensions

The `SpecialPagesGenerator` can be extended to generate:
- Search page (`search.html`)
- Offline page for PWA (`offline.html`)
- Custom error pages (500, etc.)
- Maintenance mode pages

Just add new generation methods following the `_generate_404()` pattern.

---

## Configuration

404 page generation is **always enabled** (important for production deployments).

To disable (not recommended):
```python
# In special_pages.py, modify generate() method
# Or filter out the task in postprocess orchestrator
```

---

## Notes

- The 404 template already existed and was well-designed
- Only needed to add the generation mechanism
- Fully reuses existing template engine and context
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- Works with all themes (default and custom)
