# Build Pipeline Diagram Corrections Summary
**Date:** October 5, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

## What Was Fixed

The Build Pipeline Flow diagram in `ARCHITECTURE.md` (lines 417-538) has been completely rewritten to accurately reflect the actual implementation.

## Major Corrections Made

### 1. Fixed Discovery Flow ✅
**Before:** `Site.build()` → `Discovery` classes directly  
**After:** `Site.build()` → `BuildOrchestrator` → `ContentOrchestrator` → Discovery classes

### 2. Added Missing Orchestration Layer ✅
Added all specialized orchestrators:
- ContentOrchestrator
- TaxonomyOrchestrator
- MenuOrchestrator
- IncrementalOrchestrator
- RenderOrchestrator
- AssetOrchestrator
- PostprocessOrchestrator

### 3. Fixed Incremental Build Representation ✅
**Before:** Per-page checks in rendering loop  
**After:** Bulk filtering in Phase 5, then process filtered lists in Phase 6

### 4. Added All 10 Build Phases ✅
Now shows complete phase sequence:
- Phase 0: Initialization
- Phase 1: Content Discovery
- Phase 2: Section Finalization (was missing)
- Phase 3: Taxonomies & Dynamic Pages
- Phase 4: Menus
- Phase 5: Incremental Filtering (was merged into rendering)
- Phase 6: Render Pages
- Phase 7: Process Assets
- Phase 8: Post-processing
- Phase 9: Cache Update
- Phase 10: Health Check (was missing)

### 5. Fixed Post-processing Details ✅
**Before:** Individual method calls (`generate_sitemap()`, `generate_rss()`, `generate_search_index()`)  
**After:** Single `run()` call that executes tasks in parallel, including:
- generate_special_pages()
- generate_sitemap()
- generate_rss()
- generate_output_formats() (not "search_index")
- validate_links()

### 6. Added Parallel Processing Indicators ✅
Now shows `par` blocks for:
- Phase 6: Parallel page rendering
- Phase 7: Parallel asset processing
- Phase 8: Parallel post-processing tasks

### 7. Added Architecture Pattern Documentation ✅
Added section explaining key patterns:
- Delegation pattern
- Specialized orchestrators
- Bulk filtering for incremental builds
- Parallelization strategy
- Menu access pattern

## Verification Details

Full verification details available in:
- `plan/completed/BUILD_PIPELINE_DIAGRAM_VERIFICATION_OCT5_2025.md`

This document includes:
- Line-by-line code references
- Side-by-side comparisons
- Source file analysis for all orchestrators

## Impact

The diagram now accurately represents:
✅ The delegation/orchestration architecture  
✅ All 10 build phases in correct sequence  
✅ How incremental builds filter before rendering  
✅ Parallel processing capabilities  
✅ Specialized orchestrator responsibilities
