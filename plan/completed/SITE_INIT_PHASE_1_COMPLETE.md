# Site Init - Phase 1 Complete ✅

**Date**: 2025-10-12  
**Status**: Phase 1 MVP Complete

## What Was Built

Successfully implemented the core `bengal init` command with all Phase 1 features.

### Features Implemented

✅ **Basic Command Structure**
- New command: `bengal init`
- Click-based CLI with styled output
- Integrated with main Bengal CLI

✅ **Core Functionality**
- `--sections` flag for comma-separated section names
- Automatic slug generation from section names
- Section index (`_index.md`) generation
- Sample page generation with `--with-content`
- Configurable pages per section with `--pages-per-section`

✅ **Smart Defaults**
- Auto-incrementing weights (10, 20, 30...)
- Context-aware page names (blog vs projects vs docs)
- Staggered dates for blog posts (most recent first)
- TODO comments in generated files

✅ **Safety Features**
- `--dry-run` to preview without creating files
- `--force` to overwrite existing content
- Warnings for existing sections
- Name sanitization (spaces to hyphens, special chars removed)
- Atomic writes for crash safety

✅ **User Experience**
- Beautiful tree-style output
- File size previews in dry-run
- Color-coded messages (warnings, success, info)
- Helpful next steps after completion
- Emojis for visual clarity

## Usage Examples

### Basic Section Creation
```bash
bengal init --sections "blog,projects,about"
```

### With Sample Content
```bash
bengal init --sections "blog" --with-content --pages-per-section 10
```

### Preview Mode
```bash
bengal init --sections "docs,guides" --dry-run
```

### Overwrite Existing
```bash
bengal init --sections "blog" --force
```

## Example Output

```bash
$ bengal init --sections "blog,projects" --with-content

✨ Site initialized successfully!

Created:
  • 2 sections
  • 6 pages

📚 Next steps:
  1. Review and customize generated content
  2. Run 'bengal serve' to preview your site
  3. Edit files in content/ to add your content
```

## Generated Content Quality

### Section Index Example
```markdown
---
title: Blog
description: Blog section
type: section
weight: 10
---

# Blog

This is the blog section. Add your content here.

<!-- TODO: Customize this section -->
```

### Sample Page Example
```markdown
---
title: Welcome Post
date: 2025-10-12T12:44:55.466435
draft: false
description: Sample page in the Blog section
tags: [sample, generated]
---

# Welcome Post

This is a sample page in the Blog section.

## Getting Started

Replace this content with your own.

<!-- TODO: Replace this sample content -->
```

## Testing Results

All features tested and working:

✅ Section creation  
✅ Sample content generation  
✅ Name sanitization (spaces, special chars)  
✅ Dry-run preview  
✅ Force overwrite  
✅ Existing section warnings  
✅ Staggered dates for blog posts  
✅ Context-aware page naming  
✅ Tree-style output formatting  
✅ File size calculations  
✅ Help text display  
✅ Command integration in main CLI  

## Code Quality

- **No linting errors**
- **Atomic writes** for crash safety
- **Type hints** throughout
- **Error handling** with graceful failures
- **Consistent styling** with other Bengal commands

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `bengal/cli/commands/init.py` (397 lines)

### Modified Files
- `bengal/cli/__init__.py` (added import and registration)

## What's Next: Phase 2

The next phase will add the wizard experience:

- [ ] Interactive prompt in `bengal new`
- [ ] Preset selection UI (blog, docs, portfolio, business)
- [ ] Preview before generation in wizard
- [ ] `--no-init` flag for `bengal new`
- [ ] `--init` shorthand flag for `bengal new`

## Key Learnings

1. **Tree-style output** is tricky - required careful handling of last item markers
2. **Relative path calculation** needs try/catch for edge cases
3. **Context-aware naming** makes generated content feel more intentional
4. **Staggered dates** for blog posts is a nice touch users will appreciate
5. **Dry-run is essential** for user confidence before file creation

## Metrics

- **Development time**: ~90 minutes
- **Lines of code**: 397
- **Commands added**: 1
- **Flags implemented**: 5
- **Test scenarios covered**: 11+

**Ready for Phase 2!** 🚀
