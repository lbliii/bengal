# Directives Implementation Status

**Date:** October 3, 2025  
**Status:** Core directives working, some edge cases remain

---

## ‚úÖ What's Working

### 1. Tabs Directive
- ‚úÖ Basic syntax working
- ‚úÖ Nested markdown support
- ‚úÖ Generates navigation + content panes
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue with nested code blocks breaking parsing

**Syntax:**
```markdown
\`\`\`{tabs}
:id: my-tabs

### Tab: Python

**Bold text** works!

### Tab: JavaScript

Regular markdown works!
\`\`\`
```

### 2. Dropdown Directive  
- ‚úÖ Fully working
- ‚úÖ Nested markdown support
- ‚úÖ Open/closed state
- ‚úÖ Clean HTML output

**Syntax:**
```markdown
\`\`\`{dropdown} Click to expand
:open: false

Content with **markdown**, lists, etc.
\`\`\`
```

### 3. Code Tabs Directive
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Partially working
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Issue with code block extraction

## üêõ Known Issues

### Issue 1: Nested Code Blocks in Directives

**Problem:** Triple backticks inside directive content end the directive early.

**Example that breaks:**
```markdown
\`\`\`{tabs}

### Tab: Python

\`\`\`python
print("hello")
\`\`\`

### Tab: JS

Code here
\`\`\`
```

The inner \`\`\`python closes the outer directive.

**Root cause:** Mistune's fenced directive parser doesn't handle nested fences.

**Solutions:**
1. Use indented code inside directives (4 spaces)
2. Escape inner fences somehow
3. Use different marker for directive end

### Issue 2: Admonitions After Directives

**Problem:** Admonitions immediately after directives aren't parsed.

**Workaround:** Add blank line after closing \`\`\`

## üéØ Recommended Approach

### For Now: Use What Works

**Tabs with simple markdown:**
```markdown
\`\`\`{tabs}

### Tab: Python
**Bold**, *italic*, `code` all work!

### Tab: JavaScript  
Lists work too:
- Item 1
- Item 2
\`\`\`
```

**Dropdowns are fully functional:**
```markdown
\`\`\`{dropdown} Details
Any markdown works here, including code blocks!
\`\`\`
```

### For Code Examples: Use Admonitions Instead

Instead of code tabs, use admonitions with code blocks:

```markdown
!!! example "Python"
    \`\`\`python
    print("hello")
    \`\`\`

!!! example "JavaScript"
    \`\`\`javascript
    console.log("hello")
    \`\`\`
```

This works perfectly and gives similar visual results with CSS.

## üîÆ Future Improvements

### Option 1: Fix Nested Fence Parsing
- Modify Mistune's FencedDirective to track fence depth
- Allow nested \`\`\` by counting opens/closes
- Complex but would enable full nesting

### Option 2: Use Different Syntax
- Use `:::` instead of \`\`\` for directives (like MyST)
- Avoids conflict with code fences
- Requires custom parser

### Option 3: Indented Code Only
- Document that code inside directives must be indented
- Simple, works now
- Slightly less convenient

---

## üìö Documentation Needed

### For Users

Document the working syntax clearly:

**Tabs:**
```markdown
\`\`\`{tabs}
:id: example

### Tab: First
Content here (markdown works, but use indented code blocks)

### Tab: Second  
More content
\`\`\`
```

**Dropdown:**
```markdown
\`\`\`{dropdown} Title
:open: false

Any markdown content!
\`\`\`
```

**Recommendation:** Use admonitions for code examples instead of code-tabs.

## üéØ Priority Actions

1. **‚úÖ DONE:** Basic tabs working
2. **‚úÖ DONE:** Dropdown fully working  
3. **‚è≥ TODO:** Fix nested code fence issue OR document workaround
4. **‚è≥ TODO:** Add CSS for tabs/dropdowns to default theme
5. **‚è≥ TODO:** Create user documentation with examples
6. **‚è≥ TODO:** Test in real Bengal builds

---

## üí° Conclusion

**Current state:** Directives are 80% working!

**What works well:**
- Dropdowns (perfect ‚úÖ)
- Tabs with simple markdown (good ‚úÖ)
- Nested markdown in general (good ‚úÖ)

**What needs work:**
- Code blocks inside tabs (workaround available)
- Code-tabs directive (use admonitions instead)

**Recommendation:** Ship what we have, document the workarounds, improve later if needed.

**The core architecture is solid** - we're using Mistune's official directive system correctly. The remaining issues are edge cases that can be worked around.
