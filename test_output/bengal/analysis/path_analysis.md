Path Analysis for Bengal SSG.

Implements algorithms for understanding navigation patterns and page accessibility:
- Shortest paths between pages (BFS-based)
- Betweenness centrality (identifies bridge pages)
- Closeness centrality (measures accessibility)

These metrics help optimize navigation structure and identify critical pages.
