## Basic Information

**Type:** module
**Source:** bengal/rendering/pygments_cache.py

Pygments lexer caching to dramatically improve syntax highlighting performance.

Problem: pygments.lexers.guess_lexer() triggers expensive plugin discovery
via importlib.metadata on EVERY code block, causing 60+ seconds overhead
on large sites with many code blocks.

Solution: Cache lexers by language name to avoid repeated plugin discovery.

Performance Impact (measured on 826-page site):
- Before: 86s (73% in Pygments plugin discovery)
- After: ~29s (3× faster)

*Note: Template has undefined variables. This is fallback content.*
