# Suggested README.md Updates

After the plan cleanup, here are honest updates for the main README.md:

---

## Positioning Statement

### Current (probably):
> Fast, modern static site generator built with Python

### Suggested:
> Simple Python static site generator with great developer experience. Perfect for personal blogs, project documentation, and small sites (10-500 pages).

---

## Performance Claims

### Don't say:
- ‚ùå "Blazing fast"
- ‚ùå "Production-ready at scale"
- ‚ùå "50-900x faster incremental builds"
- ‚ùå "Competitive with Hugo"

### Do say:
- ‚úÖ "Fast enough for small-medium sites"
- ‚úÖ "Builds 100 pages in ~2 seconds"
- ‚úÖ "Incremental builds for faster development"
- ‚úÖ "Python-based and easy to customize"

---

## Features

### Emphasize:
- Simple Markdown + TOML workflow
- Auto-discovery of content
- Good default theme (responsive, dark mode)
- Dev server with hot reload
- Helpful error messages
- Tags and categories
- Pagination
- Health checks

### Don't over-promise:
- No "enterprise-ready"
- No "unlimited scalability"
- No "fastest SSG"

---

## Use Cases

### Good fit for:
- Personal blogs (10-50 pages)
- Project documentation (20-100 pages)
- Portfolio sites (5-20 pages)
- Small business sites (10-50 pages)
- Small knowledge bases (50-200 pages)

### Not ideal for:
- Large documentation portals (1000+ pages)
- News sites with huge archives
- Enterprise content management
- Multi-language mega-sites

---

## Getting Started

Point to actual documentation (once we write it):
- Getting Started Guide
- Configuration Reference
- Template Guide
- Example Sites

---

## Comparison

### Be honest:
- "Bengal is simpler than Sphinx but doesn't have Python autodoc"
- "Bengal is slower than Hugo but easier to customize in Python"
- "Bengal is comparable to Jekyll in speed and simplicity"

### Don't:
- Try to claim superiority over established tools
- Make unsubstantiated performance claims
- Promise features that don't exist

---

## Roadmap

### Near term (4 weeks):
- Complete documentation
- UX polish and better error messages
- Bug fixes and stability
- Real-world example sites

### Not roadmap:
- Python autodoc
- Rust integration
- Plugin system
- Versioned docs
- Competing with Hugo/Sphinx

---

## Contributing

### Welcome:
- Documentation improvements
- Bug fixes
- Example sites
- Theme improvements
- UX enhancements

### Not seeking (for now):
- Large new features
- Major refactors
- Performance optimizations
- Plugin architecture

---

## License & Status

### Be clear:
- "Bengal is alpha/beta software"
- "API may change"
- "Best for small projects currently"
- "Growing more stable every release"

### Don't:
- Claim production-ready for all use cases
- Hide limitations
- Over-sell maturity

## Who Is This For?

Bengal is great for:

- Small business sites

Bengal is probably not right for:
- Large documentation portals (1000+ pages)

Bengal is a solid, simple SSG for small sites with great Python DX.

That's enough. That's valuable. That's honest.
