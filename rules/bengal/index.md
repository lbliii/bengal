# Bengal Operating System (v2)

Central command interface for Bengal's development workflow. Supports shortcut commands, natural language understanding, and intelligent routing through **research ‚Üí RFC ‚Üí plan ‚Üí implement ‚Üí validate ‚Üí ship** cycles.

Grounded in Bengal's architecture and test suite. Incorporates advanced prompting techniques from [promptingguide.ai](https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques).

---

## Command Shortcuts

When user provides one of the following commands, perform its associated task:

```yaml
# Core Development Workflow
"::research": research          # Evidence-first research from codebase
"::rfc": rfc                    # Draft RFC from verified evidence
"::plan": plan                  # Convert RFC into actionable plan/to-dos
"::implement": implement        # Drive implementation (edits, tests, lints)
"::validate": validate          # Deep audit with self-consistency + confidence scoring
"::retro": retro                # Summarize impact; update changelog

# Utilities
"::analyze": context-analyzer   # Deep context analysis (code, tests, git, architecture)
"::improve": improve            # Reflexion loop: iterative improvement
"::?": help (context-aware)     # Context-aware help ("what should I do here?")
"::help": help (full reference) # Full command reference
"::auto": orchestrator          # Intelligent rule selection (AI decides)

# Workflow Chains
"::workflow-feature": workflows     # Full feature: research ‚Üí RFC ‚Üí plan
"::workflow-fix": workflows         # Quick fix: research ‚Üí plan ‚Üí implement
"::workflow-ship": workflows        # Pre-release: validate ‚Üí retro ‚Üí changelog
"::workflow-full": workflows        # Complete cycle: research ‚Üí ... ‚Üí retro
```

## Natural Language Support

System understands plain English requests and routes intelligently:

### Research Requests
```yaml
triggers: [investigate, explore, understand, find, how does, what is, where is]
examples:
  - "How does the rendering pipeline work?"
  - "Understand the cache dependency tracker"
  - "Where is incremental build implemented?"
routing: ::research (evidence extraction from codebase)
```

### Design Requests (RFC)
```yaml
triggers: [should we, design, architecture, options, propose, approach, tradeoffs]
examples:
  - "Should we add caching to taxonomy?"
  - "Design options for incremental assets"
  - "Architecture for plugin system"
routing: ::rfc (evidence-backed design proposal)
```

### Planning Requests
```yaml
triggers: [break down, tasks, steps, organize, structure, divide, checklist]
examples:
  - "Break down the incremental build implementation"
  - "Create a plan for refactoring the cache"
  - "What tasks are needed for this feature?"
routing: ::plan (actionable task breakdown)
```

### Implementation Requests
```yaml
triggers: [add, fix, implement, change, build, create, modify, refactor, update]
examples:
  - "Implement incremental asset processing"
  - "Fix the taxonomy index bug"
  - "Add support for custom validators"
routing: ::implement (guided code changes)
```

### Validation Requests
```yaml
triggers: [verify, check, test, validate, audit, confidence, accuracy, correct]
examples:
  - "Verify my core module changes"
  - "Validate the rendering pipeline"
  - "Check confidence of this RFC"
routing: ::validate (deep audit with confidence scoring)
```

### Improvement Requests
```yaml
triggers: [improve, enhance, refine, better, iterate, polish, fix issues]
examples:
  - "Improve this low-confidence RFC"
  - "Refine the validation results"
  - "Make this plan better"
routing: ::improve (reflexion loop)
```

### Help Requests
```yaml
triggers: [help, how, what, explain, guide, show, ?, assist]
examples:
  - "What should I do with these uncommitted changes?"
  - "Help me with this"
  - "What can I do here?"
routing: ::? (context-aware suggestions)
```

---

## Intelligent Routing

When user's intent is detected from natural language:

### Step 1: Classify Intent
- Research, RFC, Plan, Implement, Validate, Improve, or Help?
- High confidence: Route directly
- Low confidence: Ask for clarification

### Step 2: Context Detection (via context-analyzer)
- What files are open? Git status?
- Which subsystems affected (Core/Orchestration/Rendering/Cache/Health/CLI)?
- Uncommitted changes? Test coverage?
- Document age and recency?

### Step 3: Smart Routing
```yaml
if intent == RESEARCH:
  if broad_exploratory:
    use: ::research (full scan of bengal/)
  elif focused_on_module:
    use: ::research (scoped to specific subsystem)

if intent == RFC:
  if has_evidence:
    use: ::rfc (draft from evidence)
  else:
    chain: ::research ‚Üí ::rfc (gather evidence first)

if intent == PLAN:
  if has_rfc:
    use: ::plan (convert RFC to tasks)
  elif simple_task:
    use: ::plan (direct task breakdown)
  else:
    chain: ::research ‚Üí ::rfc ‚Üí ::plan (full design flow)

if intent == IMPLEMENT:
  if has_plan:
    use: ::implement (execute plan)
  else:
    chain: ::plan ‚Üí ::implement (create plan first)

if intent == VALIDATE:
  if critical_changes_core_or_api:
    use: ::validate (deep audit, 3-path self-consistency)
  else:
    use: ::validate (standard verification)

if intent == IMPROVE:
  if validation_shows_low_confidence:
    use: ::improve (reflexion loop, up to 3 iterations)
  else:
    suggest: "Confidence already high, manual review recommended"

if intent == HELP:
  use: ::? (context-aware suggestions based on open files and git status)
```

### Step 4: Confirmation (for Destructive Actions)
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è **Confirm Action**

You've requested: "[user query]"

This will:
- Modify [N] files in bengal/core/
- Update [N] test files
- Run linter and fix issues

**Affected files**: [list]

Proceed? (yes/no)
```

---

## Key Principles

1. **Never Invent Facts** - Always verify against code/tests
2. **Evidence-First** - Claims require code references (`file:line`)
3. **Self-Consistency** - Validate critical claims via 3 paths (code, tests, config)
4. **Transparent Confidence** - Explicit scoring with formula
5. **Iterative Improvement** - Reflexion loop for low confidence
6. **Bengal-Aware** - Understands all subsystems and architecture

---

## Command Decision Guide

### "Which workflow should I use?"

**Use `::workflow-feature`** when:
- Starting a new feature from scratch
- Need full design documentation
- Architectural changes required
- Output: Research ‚Üí RFC ‚Üí Plan (ready for implementation)

**Use `::workflow-fix`** when:
- Fixing a bug or small improvement
- Changes are straightforward
- No RFC needed
- Output: Research ‚Üí Plan ‚Üí Implementation ‚Üí Validation

**Use `::workflow-ship`** when:
- Feature is implemented
- Pre-merge validation needed
- Ready to update changelog
- Output: Validation ‚Üí Retrospective ‚Üí Changelog

### "Should I validate before or after implementation?"

**Validate Before (::validate on RFC/Plan)** when:
- Critical API changes
- Core module modifications (bengal/core/, bengal/orchestration/)
- Need confidence before investing time in implementation

**Validate After (::validate on code)** when:
- Implementation complete
- Pre-commit check
- Ensure tests and confidence meet gates

### "Should I use shortcuts or natural language?"

**Use Shortcuts** when:
- You know exactly what you want
- Want fastest execution
- Familiar with the system

**Use Natural Language** when:
- Not sure which command to use
- Describing a goal rather than a specific action
- Want the system to figure out best approach

**Use `::auto`** when:
- Want AI to analyze context and decide
- Complex scenario with multiple possible approaches
- Learning the system

## Confidence Scoring

### Formula
```yaml
confidence = Evidence(40) + Consistency(30) + Recency(15) + Tests(15) = 0-100%
```

### Interpretation
- **90-100%**: HIGH üü¢ (ship it)
- **70-89%**: MODERATE üü° (review recommended)
- **50-69%**: LOW üü† (needs work)
- **< 50%**: UNCERTAIN üî¥ (do not ship)

### Quality Gates
```yaml
rfc_confidence: 85%           # RFC must have strong evidence
plan_confidence: 85%          # Plan must be well-grounded
implementation_core: 90%      # Core modules require highest confidence
implementation_other: 85%     # Other modules slightly lower
```

- **[research.md](research.md)** - Evidence extraction from codebase
- **[rfc.md](rfc.md)** - RFC drafting with design options
- **[plan.md](plan.md)** - Task breakdown and sequencing
- **[implement.md](implement.md)** - Guided code changes with guardrails
- **[validate.md](validate.md)** - Deep validation with confidence scoring
- **[improve.md](improve.md)** - Reflexion loop for iterative refinement
- **[retro.md](retro.md)** - Retrospectives and changelog updates
- **[workflows.md](workflows.md)** - Pre-built workflow chains
- **[confidence-scoring.md](confidence-scoring.md)** - Transparent scoring formula
- **[communication-style.md](communication-style.md)** - Output formatting standards

Each rule file is automatically activated when working with relevant file types (see frontmatter globs).

---

## Tips

1. **Start with Research**: Use `::research` to understand before planning
2. **Use Workflows**: Pre-built chains save time (`::workflow-feature`, `::workflow-fix`)
