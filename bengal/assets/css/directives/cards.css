/**
 * Directive Base CSS: Cards
 *
 * Cards have no universal functional requirements.
 * Everything is theme-controlled.

 * This file exists for completeness and to document the intentional

 * NOT included (theme responsibility):
 *   - Grid layout
 *   - Shadows, hover effects
 *   - Colors, borders, backgrounds
 *   - Typography, spacing
 *   - Any aesthetic choices
