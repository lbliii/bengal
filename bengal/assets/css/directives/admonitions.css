/**
 * Directive Base CSS: Admonitions
 *
 * Admonitions (notes, warnings, tips, etc.) have no universal functional
 * requirements. Everything is theme-controlled.
 *
 * This file exists for completeness and to document the intentional
 * absence of base styles.
 *
 * NOT included (theme responsibility):
 *   - Layout (borders, backgrounds, icons)
 *   - Colors (type-specific colors: info, warning, danger, etc.)
 *   - Typography, spacing
 *   - Any aesthetic choices
 *
 * @see RFC: Shared Directive Base CSS (plan/rfc-directive-base-css.md)
