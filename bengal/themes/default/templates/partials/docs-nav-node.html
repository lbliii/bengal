{#
DEPRECATED: Navigation Node Component

This template is no longer used. The nav_node macro is now inlined
in docs-nav.html for ~3x faster rendering.

Reason: Recursive {% include %} was causing 11,000+ template instantiations
per page render. Converting to a macro eliminates this overhead.

See: plan/drafted/rfc-benchmark-refresh-and-worker-optimization.md

If you're including this template directly, update to use docs-nav.html instead.
