# RFC & Planning Workflow

Bengal uses a streamlined RFC process with 4 stages:

```
drafted/ → evaluated/ → ready/ → DELETED
```

## Directory Structure

```
plan/
├── drafted/     # New RFCs and plans being written
├── evaluated/   # Reviewed, decision pending
└── ready/       # Approved, ready for implementation
```

**When work is DONE → DELETE the file.** Completed work is documented in `changelog.md`, not archived.

---

## Workflow Stages

### Stage 1: `drafted/`
- New RFCs and plans go here
- Use `rfc-[name].md` for design proposals
- Use `plan-[name].md` for implementation breakdowns
- Use `research-[name].md` for exploratory research
- Status in file: `Draft`

### Stage 2: `evaluated/`
- RFC has been reviewed and assessed
- Confidence score calculated (≥85% required to proceed)
- Open questions resolved
- Status in file: `Evaluated`

### Stage 3: `ready/`
- Approved and ready for implementation
- Tasks broken down with clear atomic commits
- Status in file: `Ready`

### Stage 4: DELETED
- **When implementation is complete, DELETE the file**
- Add changelog entry to `changelog.md`
- Work is tracked in git history, not in plan/

## File Naming

```
plan/drafted/rfc-[short-kebab-name].md     # Design proposals
plan/drafted/plan-[short-kebab-name].md    # Implementation plans
plan/drafted/research-[short-kebab-name].md # Exploratory research
```

---

## Moving Files Between Stages

```bash
# Draft complete, ready for review
mv plan/drafted/rfc-foo.md plan/evaluated/

# Approved, ready to implement
mv plan/evaluated/rfc-foo.md plan/ready/

# Implementation complete
rm plan/ready/rfc-foo.md
# Add entry to changelog.md
```
