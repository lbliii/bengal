# Bengal Implementation Planning

**Purpose**: Convert RFCs into actionable task lists with atomic commits.

**Shortcut**: `::plan`

---

## Plan Lifecycle

Plans follow the same workflow as RFCs:

```
drafted/ → evaluated/ → ready/ → DELETED
```

Create plans in `plan/drafted/plan-[name].md`, then move through stages.

---

## Plan Template

```markdown
# Plan: [Title]

**RFC**: `rfc-[name].md` (if applicable)
**Status**: Draft | Evaluated | Ready
**Created**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Estimated Time**: [hours/days]

---

## Summary

## Task Structure

Each task should:
1. **Be atomic**: One task = one commit
2. **List files**: Specific files to modify
3. **Have clear action**: What exactly to do
4. **Include commit message**: Pre-drafted, follows commit conventions

---

## Grouping Tasks

Group by Bengal subsystem:

| Area | Directory |
|------|-----------|
| Core | `bengal/core/` |
| Orchestration | `bengal/orchestration/` |
| Rendering | `bengal/rendering/` |
| Cache | `bengal/cache/` |
| Health | `bengal/health/` |
| CLI | `bengal/cli/` |
| Tests | `tests/` |
| Docs | `architecture/`, README |

---

## Completion

When all tasks complete:
1. Add entry to `changelog.md`
2. Delete the plan file
3. Commit: `docs(changelog): add [feature] entry`
