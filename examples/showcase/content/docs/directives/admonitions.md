## Markdown Support

Admonitions support full markdown:

````markdown
```{tip} Formatting Support
You can use:

- **Bold** and *italic* text
- `Inline code`
- [Links](https://example.com)
- Lists (ordered and unordered)

\`\`\`python
# Even code blocks!
print("Hello")
\`\`\`
```
````

- `Inline code`
- [Links](https://example.com)

\`\`\`python

print("Hello")
\`\`\`
```

## Common Patterns

### Prerequisites

````markdown
```{note} Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you have:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager
- Git installed
```
````

### Breaking Changes

````markdown
```{warning} Breaking Change in 2.0
The `oldFunction()` has been removed. Use `newFunction()` instead:

\`\`\`python
# Old (no longer works)
oldFunction(arg)

# New
newFunction(arg)
\`\`\`
```
````

### Installation Tips

````markdown
```{tip} Installation Shortcut
Skip the full installation with:

\`\`\`bash
pip install bengal && bengal new site mysite
\`\`\`
```
````

### Security Warnings

````markdown
```{danger} Security Warning
Never commit API keys or secrets to version control. Use environment variables instead.
```
````

### Troubleshooting

````markdown
```{error} Build Fails with "Config Not Found"
**Cause:** Missing `bengal.toml` configuration file.

**Solution:**

1. Create `bengal.toml` in your project root
2. Add minimal configuration:

   \`\`\`toml
   [site]
   title = "My Site"
   \`\`\`
3. Run `bengal site build` again
```
````

### Success Messages

````markdown
```{success} Deployment Successful
Your site is live at https://yoursite.com!

Next steps:
- Test all pages
- Verify links work
- Check analytics setup
```
````

## Title Options

### With Title (Recommended)

````markdown
```{note} Configuration Note
The title provides context.
```
````

### Without Title (Auto-generated)

````markdown
```{note}
Bengal auto-generates "Note" as the title.
```
````

**Result:** Title becomes "Note" (capitalized type name)

## Best Practices

### Use Sparingly

```{warning} Don't Overuse
Too many callouts reduce their impact. Aim for 1-3 admonitions per page.
```

**Good:** Highlight truly important information  
**Too much:** Every paragraph in a callout

### Choose Appropriate Type

```markdown
‚úÖ Use {danger} for data loss warnings
‚úÖ Use {tip} for helpful suggestions  
‚úÖ Use {note} for important information
‚ùå Don't use {danger} for minor issues
‚ùå Don't use {success} for errors
```

### Keep Content Focused

**Good:**
````markdown
```{tip} Performance Tip
Enable parallel builds with `--parallel` for 2-4x faster performance.
```
````

**Too verbose:**
````markdown
```{tip} Tips and Tricks
Here are many tips including performance, organization, writing style, deployment strategies, and more...
(Should be split into multiple focused admonitions or regular content)
```
````

### Provide Action Items

Include what users should do:

````markdown
‚úÖ Actionable:
```{warning} Version Mismatch
Your Bengal version (0.1.0) is outdated. Update with:
\`\`\`bash
pip install --upgrade bengal
\`\`\`
```

‚ùå Vague:
```{warning}
Your version might be old.
```
````

## Nesting Admonitions

You can nest admonitions inside other directives:

````markdown
```{tabs}
:id: install-tabs

### Tab: macOS

```{note} macOS Requirements
Requires macOS 10.15 or higher.
```

\`\`\`bash
brew install bengal
\`\`\`

### Tab: Linux

```{note} Linux Requirements
Requires Ubuntu 20.04 or equivalent.
```

\`\`\`bash
apt install bengal
\`\`\`
```
````
