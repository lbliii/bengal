## Best Practices

### Use Sparingly

```{warning} Don't Overuse
Too many buttons reduce their effectiveness. Use 1-3 buttons per section.
```

**Good:** 1-2 buttons for main actions  
**Too many:** 5+ buttons competing for attention

### Clear Action Text

````markdown
‚úÖ Good (action-oriented):
```{button} Download Now
```{button} Get Started
```{button} Sign Up Free

‚ùå Vague:
```{button} Click Here
```{button} Go
```{button} Link
````

### Prioritize Actions

````markdown
‚úÖ Good (clear hierarchy):
```{button} Start Free Trial      # Primary
:type: primary
```

```{button} Learn More           # Secondary
:type: secondary
```

‚ùå Unclear (both primary):
```{button} Option A
:type: primary
```

```{button} Option B
:type: primary
```
````

### Combine with Cards

````markdown
```{cards}
:columns: 2

```{card} For Writers
:icon: ‚úçÔ∏è
