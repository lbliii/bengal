# rendering.pygments_cache

Pygments lexer caching to dramatically improve syntax highlighting performance.

Problem: pygments.lexers.guess_lexer() triggers expensive plugin discovery
via importlib.metadata on EVERY code block, causing 60+ seconds overhead
on large sites with many code blocks.

Solution: Cache lexers by language name to avoid repeated plugin discovery.

Performance Impact (measured on 826-page site):
- Before: 86s (73% in Pygments plugin discovery)
- After: ~29s (3Ã— faster)

## Functions

### `get_lexer_cached`
```python
def get_lexer_cached(language: str | None = None, code: str = '') -> any
```

Get a Pygments lexer with aggressive caching.

Strategy:
1. If language specified: cache by language name (fast path)
2. If no language: hash code sample and cache guess result
3. Fallback: return text lexer if all else fails



:::{rubric} Parameters
:class: rubric-parameters
:::
- **`language`** (`str | None`) = `None` - Optional language name (e.g., 'python', 'javascript')
- **`code`** (`str`) = `''` - Code content (used for guessing if language not specified)

:::{rubric} Returns
:class: rubric-returns
:::
`any` - Pygments lexer instance

Performance:
    - Cached lookup: ~0.001ms
    - Uncached lookup: ~30ms (plugin discovery)
    - Cache hit rate: >95% after first few pages




---
### `clear_cache`
```python
def clear_cache()
```

Clear the lexer cache. Useful for testing or memory management.







---
### `get_cache_stats`
```python
def get_cache_stats() -> dict
```

Get cache statistics for monitoring.



:::{rubric} Returns
:class: rubric-returns
:::
`dict` - Dict with hits, misses, guess_calls, hit_rate




---
### `log_cache_stats`
```python
def log_cache_stats()
```

Log cache statistics. Call at end of build for visibility.
