# About This Blog

This is a demo blog built with **Bengal**, a modern Python static site generator.

## About Bengal

Bengal makes it easy to build fast, beautiful static sites with:

- **Environment-aware configuration** - Different settings for local, preview, and production
- **Build profiles** - Optimize for writers, theme developers, or core developers
- **Feature toggles** - Enable RSS, search, sitemaps with simple flags
- **Fast builds** - Parallel processing and incremental updates
- **Great DX** - Introspection tools to understand your configuration

## Configuration

This blog uses the new **config directory structure**:

```
config/
├── _default/           # Base settings
├── environments/       # local, preview, production
└── profiles/          # writer, theme-dev, dev
```

This makes it easy to have different settings for different deployment environments!
