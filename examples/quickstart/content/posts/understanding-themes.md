# Understanding Bengal Themes

Themes in Bengal are designed to be simple yet powerful. They use Jinja2 templates and modern CSS.

## Theme Structure

    templates/
      base.html
      page.html
      post.html
    assets/
      css/

```

## Customizing Themes

You can easily customize any theme by overriding templates or assets in your site directory.
