Build context for sharing state across build phases.

Provides BuildContext dataclass for passing shared state between build phases,
replacing scattered local variables. Created at build start and populated
incrementally as phases execute.

Key Concepts:
    - Shared context: Single context object passed to all build phases
    - Phase coordination: Enables phase-to-phase communication
    - State management: Centralized build state management
    - Lifecycle: Created at build start, populated during phases

    - bengal.utils.build_stats: Build statistics collection
    - bengal.utils.progress: Progress reporting

## Classes




### `BuildContext`


Shared build context passed across build phases.

This context is created at the start of build() and passed to all _phase_* methods.
It replaces local variables that were scattered throughout the 894-line build() method.

Lifecycle:
    1. Created in _setup_build_context() at build start
    2. Populated incrementally as phases execute
    3. Used by all _phase_* methods for shared state

Categories:
    - Core: site, stats, profile (required)
    - Cache: cache, tracker (initialized in Phase 0)
    - Build mode: incremental, verbose, quiet, strict, parallel
    - Work items: pages_to_build, assets_to_process (determined in Phase 2)
    - Incremental state: affected_tags, affected_sections, changed_page_paths
    - Output: cli, progress_manager, reporter


:::{info}
