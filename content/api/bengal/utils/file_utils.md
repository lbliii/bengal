File utility functions for common file operations.

Provides file hashing and other file manipulation utilities used throughout
the codebase. Focuses on efficient file operations with chunked reading.

Key Concepts:
    - File hashing: SHA256 hash computation for change detection
    - Chunked reading: Efficient file reading in chunks for large files
    - Path handling: Path-based file operations

Related Modules:
    - bengal.cache.build_cache: Uses file hashing for change detection
    - bengal.core.asset: Asset fingerprinting using file hashes

See Also:
    - bengal/utils/file_utils.py:hash_file() for file hashing

## Functions



### `hash_file`


```python
def hash_file(file_path: Path, chunk_size: int = 8192) -> str
```
