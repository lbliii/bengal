Theme resolution and inheritance chain building.

Resolves theme inheritance chains by reading theme.toml files and following
extends relationships. Supports site themes, installed themes, and bundled themes.
Builds complete inheritance chains for template and asset discovery.

Key Concepts:
    - Theme inheritance: Child themes extend parent themes
    - Resolution order: Site themes → installed themes → bundled themes
    - Chain building: Recursive resolution of extends relationships
    - Template discovery: Uses inheritance chain for template lookup
