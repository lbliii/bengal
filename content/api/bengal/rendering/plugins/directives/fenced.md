Patched FencedDirective to support indentation and code block awareness.

Mistune's default FencedDirective has two issues:
1. Does not support indented directives (e.g. inside lists)
2. Does not skip ::: sequences inside fenced code blocks

This patch fixes both issues to enable robust directive parsing.

## Classes




### `FencedDirective`


**Inherits from:**`BaseFencedDirective`FencedDirective that allows indentation and skips code blocks.

This is crucial for:
1. Nesting directives inside lists or other blocks where indentation
   is required/present
2. Showing directive syntax examples inside code blocks without the
   ::: sequences being consumed by the directive parser

Example that now works correctly:
    ::::{tab-set}
    :::{tab-item} Example
    ```markdown
    :::{note}
    This is shown as literal text, not parsed as directive
    :::
    ```
    :::
    ::::
