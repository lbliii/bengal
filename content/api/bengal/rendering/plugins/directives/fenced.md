Patched FencedDirective to support indentation.

Mistune's default FencedDirective does not support indented directives (e.g. inside lists),
unlike fenced code blocks which allow up to 3 spaces.
This patch adds support for indentation to enable robust nesting.

## Classes




### `FencedDirective`


**Inherits from:**`BaseFencedDirective`FencedDirective that allows indentation for nested directives.

This is crucial for nesting directives inside lists or other blocks
where indentation is required/present. Uses a flexible pattern that
matches directives with any amount of leading whitespace when nested
within other content blocks.
