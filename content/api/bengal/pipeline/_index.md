Reactive Dataflow Pipeline for Bengal.

This package provides a declarative dataflow architecture for building
sites. Instead of manually tracking dependencies for incremental builds,
content flows through transformation streams where changes automatically
propagate to affected outputs.

Key Components:
    - Stream: Base class for reactive streams
    - StreamItem: Items flowing through streams with caching metadata
    - Pipeline: Builder for constructing build pipelines
    - Operators: map, filter, flat_map, collect, combine

Architecture:
    Builds are defined as declarative dataflow graphs, not imperative steps.
    Dependencies are implicit in stream connections - no manual tracking.
    Fine-grained reactivity ensures only affected nodes recompute.

Example:
    >>> from bengal.pipeline import Pipeline
    >>> pipeline = (
    ...     Pipeline("build")
    ...     .source("files", discover_files)
    ...     .filter("markdown", lambda f: f.suffix == ".md")
    ...     .map("parse", parse_markdown)
    ...     .map("page", create_page)
    ...     .parallel(workers=4)
    ...     .for_each("write", write_output)
    ... )
    >>> result = pipeline.run()
