Full build pipeline that replaces orchestrators with streams.

This module implements a complete reactive dataflow pipeline for Bengal builds,
replacing the hybrid orchestrator+pipeline approach with a pure stream-based
architecture.

Pipeline Flow:
==============

1. Content Discovery
   files → parse → pages

2. Sections
   pages → finalize_sections → sections_with_indexes

3. Taxonomies
   pages → collect_tags → taxonomy_pages

4. Menus
   pages + sections → build_navigation → menu_structure

5. Assets
   assets → process → fingerprinted_assets

6. Rendering
   pages + nav + taxonomies → render → rendered_pages

7. Postprocessing
   rendered_pages → sitemap + rss + search_index

Key Benefits:
=============
- Automatic dependency tracking through stream connections
- Fine-grained reactivity (only affected nodes recompute)
- Stream-based caching (no manual DependencyTracker)
- Better incremental builds
- Streaming output (show pages as they complete)

## Functions



### `create_full_build_pipeline`


```python
def create_full_build_pipeline(site: Site) -> Pipeline
```



Create a complete build pipeline using pure streams (no orchestrators).

This replaces the hybrid approach with a full reactive dataflow pipeline
where all operations flow through streams.


**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `site` | `Site` | - | Bengal Site instance to build |







**Returns**


`Pipeline` - Complete Pipeline ready to run
:::{rubric} Examples
:class: rubric-examples
:::


```python
>>> pipeline = create_full_build_pipeline(site)
    >>> result = pipeline.run()
    >>> print(f"Built {result.items_processed} pages")
```
