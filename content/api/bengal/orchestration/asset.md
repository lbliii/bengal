Asset processing orchestration for Bengal SSG.

Handles asset copying, minification, optimization, and fingerprinting.
Coordinates parallel asset processing, generates asset manifest for
cache-busting, and manages fingerprint cleanup.

Key Concepts:
    - Parallel processing: Concurrent asset processing for performance
    - Asset manifest: JSON manifest mapping logical paths to fingerprinted files
    - Fingerprinting: Hash-based cache-busting via filename suffixes
    - Cleanup: Removal of stale fingerprinted files

Related Modules:
    - bengal.core.asset: Asset representation and processing
    - bengal.assets.manifest: Asset manifest generation
    - bengal.rendering.template_engine: Template access to asset manifest

## Classes




### `AssetOrchestrator`


Orchestrates asset processing for static files.

Handles asset copying, minification, optimization, and fingerprinting.
Supports parallel processing for performance and maintains CSS entry point
cache for efficient incremental builds.

Creation:
    Direct instantiation: AssetOrchestrator(site)
        - Created by BuildOrchestrator during build
        - Requires Site instance with assets populated



**Attributes:**

| Name | Type | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:------------|
| `site` | - | Site instance containing assets and configuration |
| `logger` | - | Logger instance for asset processing events |
| `_cached_css_entry_points` | - | Cached CSS entry points (invalidated on asset changes) |
| `_cached_assets_id` | - | Asset list identity for cache invalidation |
| `_cached_assets_len` | - | Asset list length for cache invalidation |
| `Relationships` | - | - Uses: Asset class for asset representation and processing - Uses: AssetManifest for cache-busting manifest generation - Used by: BuildOrchestrator for asset processing phase - Uses: ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel asset processing Thread Safety: Thread-safe for parallel asset processing. Uses thread-safe locks for output operations and maintains thread-local state where needed. |







## Methods



#### `__init__`
```python
def __init__(self, site: Site)
```


Initialize asset orchestrator.


**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `site` | `Site` | - | Site instance containing assets and configuration |









#### `process`
```python
def process(self, assets: list[Asset], parallel: bool = True, progress_manager = None) -> None
```


Process and copy assets to output directory.

CSS entry points (style.css) are bundled to resolve @imports.
CSS modules are skipped (they're bundled into entry points).
All other assets are processed normally.


**Parameters:**

| Name | Type | Default | Description |
|:-----|:-----|:--------|:------------|
| `assets` | `list[Asset]` | - | List of assets to process |
| `parallel` | `bool` | `True` | Whether to use parallel processing |
| `progress_manager` | - | - | Live progress manager (optional) |







**Returns**


`None`
